<h2 style="text-align: center">POPULATION DYNAMICS</h2>

<p><b>Population dynamics</b> is the branch of life science that studies short-term and long-term changes in the size and age composition of populations, and the biological and environmental processes influencing those changes.

<p><b>Human Population Dynamics in India: -</b>
<p>As per the latest survey carried out on March, 2011, the total population of India was recorded to be 1,210,193,422 persons thus making it the second largest populated country in the world. India follows China in this race of population, the former being at number one.
<p>In July 2007, this mark had increased by a considerable number and the last recorded data had the figure of 1,129,866,154, under the Indian Population head.
<p>Rising by a considerable percentage of about 21.34%, the population of India observed a sound rise in the sex ratio by coming up to 933 from 927 as at the 1991 Census that recorded a total population of 1,027,015,247 persons comprising of 531,277,078 males and 495,738,169 females.
<p>India supports a total of 15% of the global population at a mere 2.4% of the world's land area. The country has about 70% of its population residing in rural areas centered in about 550,000 villages.

<p>Factors affecting Population Dynamics of any organism species: -</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Birth
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Death
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Emigration
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Immigration
<br>[For Example: - A person emigrated FROM USA and immigrated TO India] - [an act of leaving the native place and settling in a place which is not native]

<p></b>Relation between factors effecting Population Dynamics: -</b> 
<p>For any Organism (in any region): -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Birth increases its population
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Death decreases its population
<p>(If death rate is more than birth rate, population decreases and if opposite happens, population increases)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Emigration decreases, while
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Immigration increases the population of an organism in a particular area.
<p>For human population, there is a high need that birth rate and death rates should be equal, considering the present conditions of environment (if birth rate is less, it will be better).

<p><b>Age Structure / Population pyramid: -</b> 
<p>Age structure is a graphical illustration that shows the distribution of various age groups in population, which forms a pyramid structure when the population is growing. Therefore it is also called Population Pyramid.

<p><b>Significance of Age Structure: -</b> 
<p>It provides an approximation of the number of people of a particular age / age group.
<p>For example, in India, the persons below 14 will not go to work and above 60 (or 62) are retired. So, we will get an approximation of employable and unemployable people by this difference.

<p><b>Types of population pyramids -</b> 
<p>There are generally three types of population pyramids created from age-sex distributions - 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. <u>EXPANSIVE</u> population pyramids show larger numbers or percentages of the population in the younger age groups. These types of pyramids are usually found in populations with very large fertility rates and lower than average life expectancies. The age-sex distributions of many Third World countries would probably display expansive population pyramids.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <u>CONSTRICTIVE</u> population pyramids display lower numbers or percentages of younger people. The age-sex distributions of the United States fall into this type of pyramid.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. <u>STATIONARY</u> or near-stationary population pyramids display somewhat equal numbers or percentages for almost all age groups. Of course, smaller figures are still to be expected at the oldest age groups. The age-sex distributions of some European countries, especially Scandinavian ones, will tend to fall into this category.

<p><b>Survivorship Curves: -</b> 
<p>A <b>survivorship curve</b> is a graph showing the number or proportion of individuals surviving at each age for a given species or group (e.g. males/females). Survivorship curves can be constructed for a given cohort [a group of individuals of roughly the same age] based on a life table.

<p style="text-align: center">Fig. 3. Survivorship Curve

<p>There are three generalized types of survivorship curve, which are simply referred to as Type I, Type II and Type III curves.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <b>Type I</b> survivorship curves are characterized by high survival in early and middle life, followed a rapid decline in survivorship in later life. Humans are one of the species that show this pattern of survivorship.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <b>Type II</b> curves are an intermediate between Type I and III, where roughly constant mortality rate is experienced regardless of age. Some birds follow this pattern of survival.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <b>In Type III</b> curves, the greatest mortality is experienced early on in life, with relatively low rates of death for those surviving this bottleneck. This type of curve is characteristic of species that produce a large number of offspring.

<p></b>K and r reproductive Strategies: -</b> 
<p>There is a graph of no. of organisms versus time in which that population alters. It has two variables: -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <b>K (K strategy): -</b> Maximum population in the whole graph (time period). Also called carrying capacity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <b>r (r strategy): -</b> slope of the line representing exponential growth
