<h2 style="text-align: center">CONSERVATION</h2>

<p>Conservation is an ethic of resource use, allocation, and protection. Its primary focus is upon maintaining the health of the natural world its, fisheries, habitats, and biological diversity.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_(ethic))

<p><b>Types of Conservation: -</b> 
<p>There are 2 main types of conservations of conservation of environment and its living beings: -
<p margin>In-situ and Ex-situ conservation.

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">1. <b>In-situ Conservation: -</b> In-situ conservation, the conservation of species in their natural habitats, is considered the most appropriate way of conserving biodiversity.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Conserving the areas where populations of species exist naturally is an underlying condition for the conservation of biodiversity. That's why protected areas form a central element of any national strategy to conserve biodiversity. 
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.jamaicachm.org.jm/BHS/conservation.htm)

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Institutions for in-situ conservation: - 
<p style="margin-left: 200px;">&#8226 <b>Wildlife Sanctuary: -</b> A wildlife refuge, also called a wildlife sanctuary, is a naturally occurring sanctuary, such as an island, that provides protection for species from hunting, predation or competition, it is a protected area, a geographic territory within which wildlife is protected.
<p style="text-align: right">(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_refuge)

<p style="margin-left: 200px;">&#8226 <b>National Parks: -</b> A national park is a park, in use for conservation purposes. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns.

<p style="text-align: center">Fig. 2. National Park
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park)

<p style="margin-left: 200px;">&#8226 <b>Biosphere reserves: -</b> A biosphere reserve is a voluntary, cooperative, conservation reserve created to protect the biological and cultural diversity of a region while promoting sustainable economic development. Biosphere reserves serve in some ways as 'living laboratories' for testing out and demonstrating united management of land, water and biodiversity.

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">2. <b>Ex-situ Conservation: -</b> Ex-situ conservation is the preservation of components of biological diversity outside their natural habitats.  This involves conservation of genetic resources, as well as wild and cultivated species, and draws on a diverse body of techniques and facilities.  Some of these include:
<p style="margin-left: 200px;">&#8226 Gene banks, e.g. seed banks, sperm and ova banks, field banks;
<br>&#8226 In vitro plant tissue and microbial culture collections;
<br>&#8226 Captive breeding of animals and artificial propagation of plants, with possible reintroduction into the wild;
<br>&#8226 Collecting living organisms for zoos, aquaria, and botanic gardens for research and public awareness.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.jamaicachm.org.jm/BHS/conservation.htm)

<p><b>Importance of conservation</b>
<p>There is no evidence that natural resources may last longer. But evidences are submitted that these resources a few years only. So, to retain the ability of future generation and for the sake of other creatures, conservation of natural resources is significant.

<p><b>Critical State of Indian Forests</b>
<p>In India, population growth is a major problem. This results in clearing of forest areas for obtaining land for industrial, building, infrastructure, mining and agricultural purposes.

<p><i>"A 1999 publication claimed that protected forest areas in several parts of India, such as Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Jharkhand, were vulnerable to illegal logging by timber mafias that have coopted or intimidated forestry officials, local politicians, businesses and citizenry. Clear-cutting is sometimes covered-up by conniving officials who report fictitious forest fires."	</i>
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry_in_India#Timber_mafia_and_forest_cover)

<p><b>Conflicts surrounding forested areas</b>
<p>Though not officially acknowledged, many of such forest areas covering more than 7 States of India including West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra have become hot-beds of armed conflicts of Maoists (an extremist organization). More than 6000 people have been killed during the 20-year fight of Maoists for a communist state. The Maoists are now operating in more than 223 districts of India with large tribal concentration through guerilla warfare tactics.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry_in_India)

<p><b>Populations and tribals and their rights</b>
<p>Millions of people live in and near India's forest lands, but have no legal right to their homes, lands or livelihoods. A few government officials have all the power over the forests and forest dwellers. The result? Both the forest and people die.
<p>An act was passed by the Indian government in 2006 in this context. It is called "Forests Rights Act". It recognizes the forest dwellers' rights and makes conservation accountable.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://forestrightsact.com/what-is-this-act-about)

<p><b>An introduction of this Act: -</b> 

<p><u>Land Rights</u>: - 
<p>There is no question of granting 4 hectares of land to every family.  If I am cultivating half a hectare on December 13, 2005, I receive title to that half a hectare alone; and if I am cultivating nothing, I receive nothing.  If I am cultivating more than 4 hectares without documents or a dispute, I receive title to only 4 hectares.

<p><u>Rights for the forest dwellers</u>: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">1. They can traditionally collect things like tendu patta, herbs, medicinal plants, etc.
<br>2. Grazing grounds and waterbodies
<br>3. Traditional areas of use by nomadic or pastoralist communities, that is, commodities which move with their herds.

<p><u>Right to Protection and Conserve</u>: - 
<p>Section 3(1)(i) provide a right and a power to conserve community forest resources, while section 5 gives the community a general power to protect wildlife, forests, etc.  This is vital for the thousands of village communities who are protecting their forests and wildlife against threats from forest mafias, industries and land grabbers, most of whom operate in connivance [involvement and participation] with the Forest Department. 
<p style="text-align: right">(http://forestrightsact.awardspace.com/intro.htm#mozTocId724590)

<p><b>Tourism: -</b> 
<p>The natural beauty of the forests is a gift given to us by Mother Nature. 'Sustainability' in simple terms means our responsibility to preserve and maintain the charms of nature, as it enables the next generation also to enjoy the same. Thus conservation of forests, our natural heritage, becomes most important, while practicing sustainable tourism.
<p>But when the topic comes that who should conserve and for whose profit, conflicts occur.
<p>The basic lack of cultural awareness about the places where tourists go also leads to cultural conflicts.

<br>(http://www.scribd.com/doc/30556098/Tourism-in-India-Role-in-Conflict-and-Peace)

<p><b>Poaching: -</b> 
<p>Illegal poaching of wildlife for oriental medicines, wood (timber), hides, rhino horns, elephant tusks, bear skin and bile, deer musk, and these products or raw materials increases man - animal conflict.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://projecttiger.nic.in/poaching.asp)

<p><b>Development Projects: -</b> 
<p>Various development projects are built at the cost of environment. Best examples are roads and dams.

<p><b>Roads: -</b> 
<p>Building roads may be a modern world development, but when roads are built by cutting trees, it is a great loss of environment of a country or region. Also, roads do not allow rain water to penetrate the ground and reach the underground water table.

<p><b>Dams: -</b> 
<p>While building dams whole forests of that particular area are flooded and get destroyed. Thousands of people have to leave their homes if in that area.
<p>In dams, there is a drawback of silting. And after a particular period of time, the dam is of no further use because of continuous deposition of silt carried by rivers.

<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.walkthroughindia.com/attraction/the-5-biggest-dams-in-india/)

<p><b>Overexploitation of forest resources: -</b> 
<p>Reforestation competes with other land uses such as food production, livestock grazing, and living space for further economic growth. Today, developed countries continue to utilize timber for building houses, and wood pulp for paper. In developing countries almost three billion people rely on wood for heating and cooking. Short-term economic gains made by conversion of forest to agriculture, or overexploitation of wood products, typically leads to loss of long-term income and long term biological productivity. 
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overexploitation)

<p><b>Scientific Forestry: -</b> 
<p>Scientific forestry today is "the art and science of managing forests, tree plantations, and related natural resources. The main goal is to create and implement systems that allow forests to continue a sustainable continuation of environmental supplies and services."

<p><br>The challenge is to create systems that are socially accepted while sustaining the any resource that might be affected.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091023092910AAbWG7s)

<p><br>Scientific forestry program in India was started during the colonial period in 1864.
<br>In 1885, William Schlich, the then inspector general of India, established the Royal Engineering College at Cooper's Hill, in the south of England, in order to train students for Indian Forest Service.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.hindu.com/edu/2009/09/14/stories/2009091450870300.htm)

<p><b>Limitations of scientific forestry: -</b> 
<p>A few limitations of scientific forestry are: -
<p style="margin-left: 200px;">&#8226 Scientific Forest management systems are not readily understandable.
<br>&#8226 The knowledge of scientific forestry is linked with literacy and is confined with literate people only.
<br>&#8226 Insufficient utilization of indigenous forestry. Lack of literacy among indigenous forest managers.

<p><b>Social Forestry: -</b> 
<p>Social forestry means the management and protection of forests and afforestation on barren lands with the purpose of helping in the environmental, social and rural development.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_forestry_in_India)

<p><b>Forest Department of India: -</b> 
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Administrative Units in Forest Department</b>

<p style="text-align: center">Table 1. Administrative Unit in Forest Department

<p>With respect to protection, a Beat Guard is responsible for regularly patrolling the beat and preventing any illegal act like felling of trees, poaching, encroachments, grazing, forest fires etc. or in case of occurrence reporting it to his superiors through a <b>Preliminary Offence Report (POR)</b>. In addition to protection of the forest, the Beat Guard is also responsible for various administrative, developments, welfare functions in his area, which usually includes 3-4 villages.

<p>Although the beat guard is primarily responsible for patrolling his beat, his superior up to the DFO are also required to inspect the beat periodically according to a roaster decided by the Conservator. In addition to the territorial administrative units, the Department has a system of <b>special flying squads</b> to investigate specific complaints and to reinforce and assist these units wherever necessary. This squad is located at the office of the Conservator of Forests. Moreover, the Department also has three companies of <b>Special Armed Forces (SAF)</b> on deputation from the police department to lend necessary help in the areas sensitive to forest offences. The SAF is deployed in the form of section strength in different Forest Division.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://mpforest.org/forestprotection.html)

<p><b>NGOs: -</b> 
<p>NGOs play a major role in saving the environment. They keep an eye on government and inter-governmental activities. They form programs, movements. They create awareness. They are the only institutions which have pushed the environmental issues into international level.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.iisd.org/business/ngo/roles.aspx)

<p><b>Joint Forestry Management: -</b> 
<p>Joint Forest Management often abbreviated as JFM is the official and popular term in India for partnerships in forest management involving both the state forest departments and local communities.
<p>Joint Forest Management originated in West Bengal accidentally at the Arabari Forest Range in West Midnapore, near Midnapore town in 1971. Its main focus is conservation of forests by both locals and government which will prove to be more effective than the function of a single of the two.
<p>As of 2005, 27 states of the Indian Union had various JFM schemes with over 63,000 FPCs [Forest Product Committees] involved in the joint management of over 140,000 km² of forested land. 
<p><u>Disadvantages</u>: - 
<br>JFM sometimes results into overexploitation of forests by the local communities. For example, overgrazing and desire for more agricultural land results into deforestation.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Forest_Management)

<p><b>Ecotourism: -</b> 
<p>Ecotourism is defined as "responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people."
<p>Ecotourism is about uniting conservation, communities, and sustainable travel. This means that those who implement and participate in ecotourism activities should follow the following ecotourism principles:
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Minimize impact.
<br>&#8226 Build environmental and cultural awareness and respect.
<br>&#8226 Provide positive experiences for both visitors and hosts.
<br>&#8226 Provide direct financial benefits for conservation.
<br>&#8226 Provide financial benefits and empowerment for local people.
<br>&#8226 Raise sensitivity to host countries' political, environmental, and social climate.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.ecotourism.org/what-is-ecotourism)

<p><u>Drawbacks</u>: - 
<br>A tremendous amount of money is being spent and human resources continue to be used for ecotourism despite unsuccessful outcomes, and even more money is put into public relation campaigns to dilute the effects of criticism. Some areas suffer urbanization, industrialization, and the over exploitation of agriculture.
<p style="text-align: right">(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotourism)

<p><b>Wildlife: -</b> 
<p>The greatest danger to wildlife is from man's activities. So we ourselves have created a need of wildlife conservation. Hence, National Wildlife Action Plan has been adapted in 1983 for wildlife conservation. Many wildlife sanctuaries and national parks have been established for the protection of dwindling wildlife.

<p><b>(Case Study) Project Tiger: -</b> 

<p>'Project Tiger', a centrally sponsored scheme, was launched on April 1, 1973 to save tigers. Initially, the Project started with nine tiger reserves, covering an area of 16,339 sq km. with a population of 268 tigers. And at present there are 27 tiger reserves covering an area of 37,761 sq km. with a population of 1498 tigers.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.wildlifeofindia.org/projtiger.htm)

<p>WWF - India has been working towards tiger conservation, across India by: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Reducing poaching
<br>&#8226 Protecting tiger habitats and corridors
<br>&#8226 Minimizing illegal trade of tiger parts
<br>&#8226 Increasing awareness on tiger conservation

<p><b>Failures: -</b>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Project tiger directorate is merely a guiding authority having no judicial or quasi-judicial authority. It does not have the manpower to analyze the inputs and information from state reserves. It merely acts as an advisory body. In the current scenario an authority with legal power is needed.
<br>&#8226 There is an immense lack of coordination amongst the bodies dealing with project tiger. There is no intelligence gathering system and if there is some intelligence input, there does not exist an adequate action mechanism. The state Government does not release funds received from central funds on the time. There are about 15 tiger reserves which have the area less than the prescribed area for a tiger reserve.
<br>&#8226 Funds are released by the center on time but these funds are extremely insufficient. 
<br>&#8226 The forest department has not maintained healthy relations with communities inhabiting the peripheries of these reserves. No swift action is taken on the killing of livestock by tigers.

<p><b>(Case Study) Project Elephant: -</b> 
<p>Project Elephant (PE) was launched by the Government of India in the year 1992 as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with the following objectives: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 protect elephants, their habitat & corridors
<br>&#8226 address issues of man-animal conflict
<br>&#8226 welfare of domesticated elephants

<p>India is home to between 50 and 60% of all of Asia's wild elephants and about 20% of the domesticated elephants. As such, the country is of paramount importance for the survival of the species.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.eleaid.com/index.php?page=elephantsinindia)

<p>Failures: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Female Asian elephants are not affected by ivory poaching (due to their lack of tusks), so poaching has not affected the overall population numbers of Asian elephants as drastically.
<br>&#8226 Reasons for decline include persecution of wild elephants due to the crop damage they are perceived to cause, hunting (mainly for ivory but also for meat) and habitat loss due to expanding human population and the loss of forests in Asia.
