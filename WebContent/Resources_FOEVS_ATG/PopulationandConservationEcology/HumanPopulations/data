<h2 style="text-align: center">HUMAN POPULATIONS</h2>

<p>"Go Forth And Multiply!" That's what the human population has successfully been doing for thousands and thousands of years, expanding, exploring, migrating, conquering, utilizing, evolving, civilizing, industrializing, and now, destroying the very land upon which we live.
<p>Yes, human population is increasing day-by-day, trying to dominate nature, and hence, planning destruction itself.

<p><b>Malthusian model: -</b> 
<p>The Malthusian growth model, sometimes called the “simple exponential growth model”. It was given by Thomas Robert Malthus and is named after his name. It is an exponential growth model based on a constant rate of compound interest.
<p>He also wrote essays on population. He was the first one to do this.

<p><b>Exponential growth</b> occurs when the growth rate of the value of a mathematical function is proportional to the function's current value. Exponential decay occurs in the same way when the growth rate is negative. The graph representing such a growth is called exponential growth curve or Malthusian Model.

<p>Formula – 

<p style="text-align: center"><i>P<sub>t</sub> = P<sub>0</sub> (1+r)<sup>t</sup></i>

<p>Where,
<br>P<sub>t</sub> = population at time t
<br>P<sub>0</sub> = initial population
<br>r = rate (if rate = 5% ; then r = 0.05)
<br>t = time interval

<p>Demographic Transition: - 
<p>Demographic transition is a transition from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates as a country develops. It is a model that describes population change over time. It is based on an interpretation begun in 1919 by the American demographer Warren Thompson, of the observed changes, or transitions, in birth and death rates in industrialized societies over the past two hundred years or so.
