<h2 style="text-align: center">THREATS TO THE ECOSYSTEM</h2>

<p>The increasing human population is off course putting stress to Nature. It is bringing threats to the ecosystem. Let us see in how many ways: - 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. <b>Habitat destruction; -</b> increasing population off course needs a large area and land to live on. Humans, being the most intelligent creatures on earth, are trying to control nature and availing more and more land for themselves. This leads to loss of habitat of all other creatures.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <b>Genetic erosion: -</b> Human beings have used technology such that they can survive in any type of surroundings. Thus, they are spreading in all parts of the world, occupying all places of other habitats leaving no land for other creatures to live on. Man has started killing other creatures for his own amusement. Inspite of the laws, smuggling of the animal body parts exists.
<br>All this leads to genetic erosion. In simpler language, some creatures are on the verge of extinction and many are already extinct, only because of human activities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. <b>Loss of diversity: -</b> Stress on resources for man's convenience results in loss of diversity. Many forests are lost from planet Earth. It resulted into loss of a species or decrease in its population. Human population has blurred the face of planet Earth.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. <b>Expanding agriculture: -</b> Human population rise resulted in increase in the demands of food. Also, there is greed in humans for more and more. Farmers have made a huge loss of forest cover for the sake of agriculture.
<br>Despite of this, there is no significant benefit. The use of fertilizers, pesticides, fertilizers, herbicides, and other chemical products on farmland has poisoned our food.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. <b>Impound water: -</b> [impound = to continue to reduce or seize] Use of chemical products in farmlands cause eutrophication in waterbodies. Oil spills are the indirect result of increasing demands and enhancing technology. All the industrial and household waste is discharged ultimately to water. Underground water jets are being used and they are continuously reducing the underground water level, for household and industrial purposes. Increasing air pollution acidifies and thus poisons the rainwater.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. <b>Waste from human societies: -</b> Wastes from human societies, both biodegradable and non-biodegradable are being disposed without any treatment (for example, household waste).
<br>Automobile pollution is also increasing day-by-day. Thus, it can be concluded that human society promotes all sorts of pollutions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. <b>Increasing human consumption: -</b> Increasing human consumption also increases the demands in each and every area such as food, vehicles, dwelling places, basic entities.
<br>No. of automobiles is increasing day-by-day. People prefer diesel vehicles which are economic to use but proves to be very costly for the environment. Diesel releases CO when burnt in vehicle engines.
<br>Increasing population needs more resources - more food, more land, more employment - and thus degrades the environment more.
<p>If each and every family has atmost 2 children, they will be easy to bring up and thus population can also be controlled.
