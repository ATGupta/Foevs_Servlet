<h2 style="text-align: center">BIOTECHNOLOGY</h2>

<p>BiotechnologyÂ (or biotech) is the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make useful products, or "any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use".

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Biotechnological Engineering [use in industry]
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Microbial technology refers to the use of microbes to obtain a product or service of economic value. It is also called as fermentation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Activities In Industrial Microbiology: Isolation of microorganisms from nature, Their screening for product formation, Improvement of product yields, Maintenance of cultures, Mass culture using bioreactors, and Recovery of products or services.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Applications: Metabolite production. Anaerobic digestion (for methane production). Waste treatment (both organic and industrial). Production of biocontrol agents, and Fermentation of food products. Bio based fuel & energy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Metabolite Production: Microorganisms produce a number of metabolites during their growth using cheap substrates. Acetone-butanol, Alcohol, Antibiotics, Enzymes, Organic acids Vitamins.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Biomass production: Microorganisms employed to enhance the availability of nutrients, viz., nitrogen (by fixing atmospheric N2) and phosphorus (by solubilizing soil phosphorus), to the crops are called biofertilizers. Rhizobium spp. Blue-green Algae and Azolla. Azotobacter and Azospirillum.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Recovery of Metals: Microbes can be employed to recover valuable metals from low grade ores and also from dilute solutions for which the conventional metallurgical processes are uneconomical and, generally, rather polluting. E. gleaching of copper as copper sulphate from ores. Desulphurization of Coals by Thiobacillus spp.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Production of biocontrol agents: Use of microorganisms to control insect pests, pathogens or weeds constitutes biological control, and the biological agents employed for this purpose are called biocontrol agents. Bioinsecticides-Bioherbicides-
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Fermentation of food products: Bio based fuel & energy: Ethanol currently produced by fermenting grain (old technology). Cellulose enzyme technology allows conversion of crop residues (stems, leaves and hulls) to ethanol. Results in reduced CO2 emissions by more than 90% (compared to oil).Allows for greater domestic energy production and it uses a renewable feedstock.

<p><b>Limitations of Biotechnology Application: -</b> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Loss of privacy. Medical and genetic information is more likely to be stored and shared.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Discrimination. Private insurers, employers, and governmental entities are more likely to discriminate against people who have genetic or medical anomalies, especially if such information is available in databases.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Cloning. Reproductive cloning could create "Frankensteins" [organism which can go out of control] or result in eugenic [the study of methods to improve the mental and physical characteristics of the human race by choosing who may become parents] practices. Therapeutic cloning is also regarded as unethical by some groups, primarily religious organizations.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Transformations of wild species. Exposure of wild species to genetically modified crops or domestic livestock could cause "super species" to evolve with resistance to pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Loss of biodiversity. Development of genetically modified crops or domestic livestock could reduce genetic variety among both domesticated and wild species.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) Harmful chemicals. Although biotechnology will generate many new and valuable chemicals, some chemicals with unknown or damaging environmental impacts are likely to be developed.
