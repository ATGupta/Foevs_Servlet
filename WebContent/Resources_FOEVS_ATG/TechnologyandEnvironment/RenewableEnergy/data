<h2 style="text-align: center">RENEWABLE ENERGY</h2>

<p style="text-align: right">(http://edugreen.teri.res.in/explore/renew/renew.htm)

<p>The energy which can be generated as much as we need or which can never be depleted is called renewable energy.

<p><b>Limitations of Conventional sources of Energy: -</b> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Very Costly Production Cost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Heavy Transmission & Distribution Loss.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Limited Reach.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Big Threat for Environment & Public Health.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Cause of Global Warming, Greenhouse Effect, Acid Rain Etc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Uncertainty in availability, not replenishable, available in limited amount in environment and availability depends on the rate of consumption by humans.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Electricity Tariff is increasing at about 8 to 10% p.a. on an Average.

<p><b>Renewable Energy: -</b> 
<p>Due to the limitations of conventional sources of energy, alternative sources of energy have become very important and relevant to today’s world. These sources, such as the sun and wind, can never be exhausted and therefore are called renewable sources of energy. The energy obtained by renewable sources is called renewable energy.

<p><b>Solar energy: -</b> 
<p>Solar energy is the most readily available source of energy. It does not belong to anybody and is, therefore, free. It is also the most important of the non-conventional sources of energy because it is non-polluting and, therefore, helps in lessening the greenhouse effect.
<br><b>India receives solar energy equivalent to over 5000 trillion kWh/year, which is far more than the total energy consumption of the country.</b>

<p><b>Biomass: -</b> 
<p>Biomass is a renewable energy resource derived from the carbonaceous waste of various human and natural activities. It is derived from numerous sources, including the by-products from the timber industry, agricultural crops, raw material from the forest, major parts of household waste and wood. 
<p><b>Half a kilo of dry plant tissue can produce as much as 1890 KCal of heat which is equivalent to the heat available from a quarter of kilogram of coal.
<p>Form of Energy:</b> Chemical energy

<p><b>This energy is being used for:</b> Cooking, Mechanical, Applications/Pumping, Power generation, Transportation

<p><b>Fuel cells: -</b> 
<p>Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that convert the chemical energy of a fuel directly and very efficiently into electricity (DC) and heat, thus doing away with combustion. The most suitable fuel for such cells is hydrogen or a mixture of compounds containing hydrogen. A fuel cell consists of an electrolyte sandwiched between two electrodes. Oxygen passes over one electrode and hydrogen over the other, and they react electrochemically to generate electricity, water, and heat.

<p><b>Hydel energy: -</b> 
<p>The energy in the flowing water can be used to produce electricity. Waves result from the interaction of the wind with the surface of the sea and represent a transfer of energy from the wind to the sea. Energy can be extracted from tides by creating a reservoir or basin behind a barrage and then passing tidal waters through turbines in the barrage to generate electricity.
<p><b>On an average, the 60 million sq km of tropical seas absorb solar radiation equal to the heat content of 245 billion barrels of oil.</b>

<p><b>Geothermal energy: -</b> 
<p>We live between two great sources of energy, the hot rocks beneath the surface of the earth and the sun in the sky. Our ancestors knew the value of geothermal energy; they bathed and cooked in hot springs. Today we have recognized that this resource has potential for much broader application.
<p><b>Geothermal manifestations are wide spread in India in the form of 340 hot spring sites. 
<p>Form of Energy:</b> Thermal energy
<p><b>This energy is being used for:</b> Heating/Power Generation

<p><b>Co-generation: -</b> 
<p>Co-generation is the concept of producing two forms of energy from one fuel. One of the forms of energy must always be heat and the other may be electricity or mechanical energy. In a conventional power plant, fuel is burnt in a boiler to generate high-pressure steam. This steam is used to drive a turbine, which in turn drives an alternator through a steam turbine to produce electric power. The exhaust steam is generally condensed to water which goes back to the boiler.

<p>Wind energy: - 
<p>Wind energy is the kinetic energy associated with the movement of atmospheric air. It has been used for hundreds of years for sailing, grinding grain, and for irrigation. Wind energy systems convert this kinetic energy to more useful forms of power. Wind energy systems for irrigation and milling have been in use since ancient times and since the beginning of the 20th century it is being used to generate electric power. Windmills for water pumping have been installed in many countries particularly in the rural areas.
<p><b>India ranks 5th in the world with a total wind power capacity if 1080MW out of which 1025Mwhaev been established in commercial projects.
<p>Form of Energy:</b> Kinetic energy
<p><b>This energy is used for:</b> Sailing ships, Pumping water/Irrigation, Grinding Grains, Power generation.

<p><b>Advantages of renewable sources of Energy: -</b> 
<p>One major advantage with the use of renewable energy is that as it is renewable it is therefore sustainable and so will never run out.
<p>Renewable energy facilities generally require less maintenance than traditional generators. Their fuel being derived from natural and available resources reduces the costs of operation.
<p>Even more importantly, renewable energy produces little or no waste products such as carbon dioxide or other chemical pollutants, so has minimal impact on the environment.
<p>Renewable energy projects can also bring economic benefits to many regional areas, as most projects are located away from large urban centers and suburbs of the capital cities. These economic benefits may be from the increased use of local services as well as tourism.

<p><b>Disadvantages of renewable sources of Energy: -</b> 
<p>It is easy to recognize the environmental advantages of utilizing the alternative and renewable forms of energy but we must also be aware of the disadvantages.
<p>One disadvantage with renewable energy is that it is difficult to generate the quantities of electricity that are as large as those produced by traditional fossil fuel generators. This may mean that we need to reduce the amount of energy we use or simply build more energy facilities. It also indicates that the best solution to our energy problems may be to have a balance of many different power sources.
<p>Another disadvantage of renewable energy sources is the reliability of supply. Renewable energy often relies on the weather for its source of power. Hydro generators need rain to fill dams to supply flowing water. Wind turbines need wind to turn the blades, and solar collectors need clear skies and sunshine to collect heat and make electricity. When these resources are unavailable so is the capacity to make energy from them. This can be unpredictable and inconsistent. The current cost of renewable energy technology is also far in excess of traditional fossil fuel generation. This is because it is a new technology and as such has extremely large capital cost.
