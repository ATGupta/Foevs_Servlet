<h2 style="text-align: center">TECHNOLOGICAL EVOLUTION AND MODELS</h2>

<p><b>Technology: -</b> 
<p>The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes.
<p><u>History</u>: - 
<p>"First, there was light. And it was good. Then there was water. And it was good. And then there was man. And man got bored with light and water. So man created toys. Toys that made the man's life easier. Toys that provided man with entertainment. Toys of which would make communication across vast distances easier. Man called this technology. And boy, has it come a long way.
<p>Today, cell phones are small computers. Televisions are giant windows to the world. Video games are a new form of interactive cinema. And computers rule our world. It took us a while to get here and there were certainly some interesting bumps in the road along the way. As they say, you have to learn to crawl before you learn to walk. And today, we're going to take a small visual tour of the technology of yesterday that made today possible. These relics may not have been the first of their kind, but they were the ones that were successful enough to encourage further future development of their respective technological species."

<p><u>Impact on Environment</u>: - 
<p>New and better technology is being introduced, by each passing day. In every field, new technology is introduced very frequently. This advancement of technology is beneficial, but also has adverse effects on the environment. If we consider advancement of technology in machines, it means more industrialization and poor effect on the environment. Advancement in weapons has also considerable effect on the environment. New technology means more production and more consumption like cars. They create pollution.
<br><b>Thus a technology reorientation is needed.</b>

<p><u>Impact on human society</u>: - 
<p>"Human life was highly restricted due to the unavailability of technological applications. Daily life involved a lot of physical activity. Life of the common man was not as luxurious as that of modern times, but he was more active. Exercise was integrated into routine physical activities. It was contrary to the sedentary lifestyle of today, which leaves no time for exercise and fills days with inactivity and laze. Today we don't want to, and thanks to technology, don't even need to, walk, move around or exert physically to get things done. We have the world is at our fingertips.
<p>We think of technology as a boon to society. I am afraid; it's not completely a boon. The Internet has bred many unethical practices like hacking, spamming and phishing. Internet crime is on the rise. The Internet, being an open platform lacks regulation. There is no regulation on the content displayed on websites. Internet gambling has become an addiction for many. Overexposure to the Internet has taken its toll. In this virtual world, you can be who you are not, you can be virtually living even after you die. Isn't this weird? Children are spending all their time playing online and less or almost no time playing on the ground. Youngsters are spending most of their time social networking, missing on the joys of real social life.
<p>Think of the days when there were no online messengers, no emails and no cell phones. Indeed cellular technology made it possible for us to communicate over wireless media. Web communication facilities have worked wonders in speeding long-distance communication. On the other hand, they have deprived mankind of the warmth of personal contact. Emails replaced handwritten letters and communication lost its personal touch. With the means of communication so easily accessible, that magic in waiting to reach someone and the excitement that followed have vanished.
<p>Moreover, we have become excessively dependent on technology. Is so much of dependency good? Is it right to rely on machines to such an extent? Is it right to depend on computers rather than relying on human intellect? Computer technology and robotics are trying to substitute for human intellect. With the fast advancing technology, we have started harnessing artificial intelligence in many fields. Where is the digital divide going to take us? How is our 'tomorrow' going to be? 'Machines replacing human beings' does not portray a rosy picture, does it? It can lead to serious issues like unemployment and crime. An excessive use of machines in every field can result in an under-utilization of human brains. Over time, we may even lose our intellectual abilities. You know of the declining mathematical abilities in children due to use of calculators since school, don't you?
<p>The impact of technology on society is deep. It is both positive and negative. Technology has largely influenced every aspect of living. It has made life easy, but so easy that it may lose its charm one day. One can cherish an accomplishment only if it comes after effort. But everything has become so easily available due to technology that it has lost its value. There is a certain kind of enjoyment in achieving things after striving for them. But with everything a few clicks away, there is no striving, there's only striking. With the developments in technology, we may be able to enjoy all the pricey luxuries in life but at the cost of losing its priceless joys."

<p><b>Hi-tech: -</b> 
<p>The term high tech refers to technology that is at the cutting edge: the most advanced technology currently available. It is often used in reference to micro-electronics, rather than other technologies.
<p><u>Impact on Environment</u>: - 
<p>Hi-tech has given humans more luxurious life. But it is more harmful for the environment as it exploits the environmental resources too much.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech)

<p><b>Low-tech: -</b> 
<p>Related to simple unsophisticated technology, often that used for centuries, that is limited to the production of basic necessities.
<p><u>Impact on Environment</u>: - 
<p>Low technology can be considered as non-polluting as it does not exploit the natural resources too much.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.thefreedictionary.com/low+technology)

<p><b>Intermediate Technology: -</b> 
<p>Technology which combines sophisticated ideas with cheap and readily available materials, especially for use in developing countries.
<p><u>Impact on Environment</u>: - 
<p>Intermediate technologies were thus described as relatively small, simple, capital-saving, labor-intensive, and environmentally less-damaging technologies, suitable for local, small-scale application.

<p style="text-align: center">Table 1. Appropriate technology vs. Traditional technology

<p><b>Interaction between technology, resources, environment and development: -</b> 
<p>There is a direct relation. If technology is such that it exploits environment, the development will be cyclic. Environmental Pollution will also occur surely, humankind and Earth will be in a great danger.
<p>Cyclic development means that we have to return to the same basic point of development from where we had started our journey.
<p>For example, we had started from cycles. Technology enhanced and cars and other petroleum product consumer vehicles evolved. These are exploiting the crude oil resources, causing air pollution on a high scale. Crude oil is a non-renewable resource. When it gets over, we have to come back from our luxury to our original point, i.e., cycles.

<p><b>Energy as a binding factor of Technology: -</b> 
<p>Technology without energy is naught. For example, if there is no energy, cars cannot be made, cars cannot be run, and mining cannot be done to extract iron for car. No pcs or TVs will run. No paper will be printed. That means no education will go on.
<p>Humans are too addicted to the use of luxury and modern technology to bear the hardship of life without energy.
