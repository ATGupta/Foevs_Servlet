<p>The climate of today's world is quite unfavorable. Man is using the natural resources very destructively. He is not thinking about the environment and others. Even, he is destructing himself because of his personal greed. 
<p>Temperature is rising with a high rate. Environment is being polluted. It is being degraded without any bounds. Global Warming is increasing day-by-day. Various people, organizations, etc are overusing / misusing the natural resources without thinking for the future state of environment and needs of future generation.
<p>As we look into the environment and climate of today's world, we will come to know that our earth is in a great danger. There is a high danger on each and every creature of this planet if the present destructive deeds of man are not stopped.
<p>So, I find a way to help my environment and my fellow creatures through this presentation. I hope this will affect and make the common mass, especially of Aonla region, aware of their surroundings and they will help their own mother earth to get rid of the curse of pollution.
<p>
<p>Actually this was made by me when I was not given EVS. I was inspired by my grandfather, Prof. Giriraj Nandan, who is a great historian of Aonla. He has written numerous books on the history of Ruhelkhand and its constituent cities including Aonla. He has written history on other places too.
<p>But our area of interest is different. He loves history while I love Environment. So I made it. And I found its features similar to those given in Unit 6, Ch. 2 ('s syllabus). So I include this in this book.
<p>This presentation / case study was completed by June 2011.

<h3><p style="text-align: center">INTRODUCTION</h3>

<div style="position: absolute; left: 0; right:0; margin:auto;">
\image image3
</div>
<div style="position:relative;">
<p>If we see the earth as a whole, we can watch clearly that the whole world is in a great danger.
<p>What is happening:-
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Air is being polluted. Vehicles are being used lavishly. Industries / factories are discharging hazardous gases into the atmosphere without any proper treatment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Forests are being cut. This is done for overcoming various demands of present population like wood, paper and other domestic and industrial uses.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Water is being contaminated. Water is used in various household and industrial uses. Contaminated water is discharged from industries without any previous treatment. Oil spills are very frequent.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Land is being degraded. Especially in countryside, the people throw the waste on the ground and thus degrading the land and the fertility and production capacity of land. Mining is done frequently.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Nuclear reactors, weapons are continuously in use.

<p>If this remains to happen, the following consequences will / may be / are imminent:-
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Air will be more & more polluted. Various diseases related to air like lung cancer, asthama will spread.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Average temperature of the atmosphere will rise / is rising, resulting into its own effects.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Decline in forest cover will result in scarcity of various natural sources. It will affect oxygen level, carbon-dioxide level, beauty of nature.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Water borne diseases will spread. Death of various aquatic animals will be / is one of the major consequences.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Land productivity will decline.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ugly looking pieces of land and water bodies invite various disease carrying organisms like rats, insects. This will spread their respective disease like dengue, malaria, plague.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Nuclear pollution results cancer and genetic disorders which are irreversible.

<h3><p style="text-align: center">CLIMATE OF AONLA</h3>

<p>If we see the climate conditions of Aonla, we may clearly feel that the climate is quite favorable. But there are some causes which are continuously degrading the atmosphere of the town.

<h3><p>FORESTS [TREES]</h3>

<p>Forests clean the atmosphere. They provide us with various resources. They increase the natural beauty of a site. They provide us with oxygen, the only gas which is responsible for the existence of any animal on the earth.

<p>Forests are being cut everywhere.
<br><b>In respect to forests, corruption has increased very much. It is heard forest officers earn over Rs.20000 as bribe daily and allow to cut the trees in the restricted area.</b>
<br><b>{</b>It is a true strategy. The identity is not written to avoid any kind of dispute / argument.<b>}</b>
\image image4

<p>There are clusters of trees outside the town but inside, almost all the trees have been cut. Even outside the town, the mini-forests are being continuously cleared to make building areas, houses and agricultural farm lands.
<p>Government, taking care of the environment and its citizens, is planting trees on roadsides, railway sides, etc everywhere. Cutting these trees is strictly forbidden. In Aonla also, such trees can be seen on the roads which join it to other cities.
\image image5

<p><b>Duties of a responsible citizen to help the forests to inhabit:-</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Never cut any tree.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Create awareness in oneself and even others especially, in his / her family.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Inform the administration and oppose corruption openly without any kind of hindrance or fear <u>in all issues</u>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Plant trees in any unused area if possible.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Encouragement of afforestation.

<h3><p>AIR</h3>

<p>Air is a very useful natural resource on earth. It is responsible for the existence of life anywhere on it. The air of Aonla is polluted to a high extent.
<p>Everywhere on the roads, we can see that vehicles are being used lavishly. They give out a lot of smoke and harmful gases like carbon-dioxide, carbon-monoxide into the atmosphere.
<p>Carbon-dioxide is a major gas responsible for global warming. Carbon-monoxide is a poisonous gas. It is the gas which when inhaled, forms carboxyheaemoglobin which is more stable than oxyhaemoglobin. Carbon-monoxide, if inhaled in large quantities, results in death within 10 minutes due to deficiency of oxygen and poisoning of blood.
<p>The houses are made up of cement. <b>Cement releases a lot of Carbon-monoxide into the atmosphere in the presence of sunlight and heat.</b>
\image image6

<p>The waste material is burnt. This evolves a lot of hazardous gases into the atmosphere. 
<p>Now-a-days, government is recommending to use the CNG enabled gas kits in the vehicles. This is because usage of CNG will cause less pollution as compared to petrol / diesel.
<p>Almost in every house, refrigerators are used. They release a gas called chlorofluorocarbon which reacts with the ozone layer of the earth's atmosphere.
<p>Ultraviolet rays of sun are very harmful to the living beings of earth. It hinders the growth of plants. They result in various diseases such as skin cancer and cataract and deplete the immune system of the organisms including human beings. Ozone layer prevents those rays to reach the earth by absorbing them. Due to depletion of ozone layer, these gases reach the earth and cause harm to the creatures living here.
\image image7

<p>Almost in every house, refrigerators are used. They release a gas called chlorofluorocarbon which reacts with the ozone layer of the earth's atmosphere.
\image image8

<p>There is a hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica with an area of about 27 lakh sq. km.. Now-a-days, the scientists are trying to recover that hole chemically.
\image image9
\image image10

<p><b>Duties of a responsible citizen to help in controlling air pollution and make it clean for oneself and others:-</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Create awareness in oneself and even others especially, in his / her family.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Avoid using automobiles. They are major source of air pollution.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 In industries, the evolved gases should be treated properly before discharging.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Plant trees. Trees help a lot in cleaning the atmosphere.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Using eco-friendly refrigerators and air conditioners. They use the <u>alternatives of CFCs and Methane</u> which do not harm the ozone layer.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Use of CNG enabled vehicles. CNG evolves less Carbon-dioxide as compared to petroleum.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 There is a way of getting rid of waste by burning it. This must be abolished.

<p><br>

<p><br>

<h3><p>WATER</h3>

<p>Water is a very useful natural resource. One cannot imagine life on earth without this boon of Nature.
\image image11

<p>All the waste material generated by the people of the town is lastly dumped into water only.
\image image12

<p>Aonla has a large source of portable water - ground water. So, although the residents of the town of Aonla face much problem in the context of water yet the people must think to conserve this natural resource otherwise it will be depleted soon and there will be scarcity of drinkable or even usable water in the town.
<p>We must avoid the installation of submersibles in our houses because this machine puts a great pressure on ground water level.
\image image13

<p>Ground water level's fall is a major result seen in many areas of India. Everywhere roads are built. They prevent the rain water to percolate down the ground and meet the ground water table. That is why, in big cities of India, people have adopted the use of rain water harvesting system so as to recover the ground water table.
<p>We must be aware of forthcoming danger of water scarcity. In Hindi we say:-
<br><i><b>Jal hee jeevan hai</b></i>.
<p>It means - 'Water is life'. We must not only say, but also attain it.
<p>So, we must try to conserve water. Various methods are there for us so that we may save water such as Rain Water Harvesting.

<p><b>Duties of a responsible citizen to preserve water:-</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Create awareness in oneself and even others especially, in his / her family.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Waste materials must be treated properly before they are discharged into water bodies especially, in industries.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Prevention of wastage of water.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 In the areas which are arid / semi-arid, more and more trees must be planted. Forests are responsible for the arrival of rain in such areas.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 The use of tube-wells, submersibles must be avoided.  They put a lot of pressure on ground water and reduce the level.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Rain water harvesting method should be practiced. This method helps to retain ground water level.

<p><b>Rain Water Harvesting: -</b> 
<p>It is a method to conserve water. Many big cities of India have adopted this system to conserve rain water.
<p>In this system, rain water is collected from roofs of houses. This water is filtered and finally, it reaches the ground water through pipes.

<h3><p>LAND</h3>
<p>Land is a very useful natural resource. We live on land. We get minerals from land. We grow crops on land and thus we can say that land is the only resource of our food. So, we must handle it properly.
\image image15

<p>Land pollution is frequently seen almost everywhere in Aonla. People throw waste everywhere wherever they like. In morning at about 6:30, one can see a lot of waste dumped far and wide on roadsides. This not only makes the land polluted but also makes a site uneven to look at. Here, there is no proper way available to dump the waste.
\image image16

<p>Various harmful chemical pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, fertilizers are being used by the farmers which not only may be fatal to human beings but also makes the land infertile for future growth of  crops.
<p>Dumping waste improperly makes the land barren. Plastic is being used by all the people. This material takes thousands of years to decompose. The land becomes barren in its presence.
<p>The use of inorganic chemicals in agriculture makes the land barren. The land becomes addicted to it. No more cropping can be done without its further use. It is harmful to humans and other organisms. It is researched that the percentage of DDT is increasing along the food chain.
<p>The waste material dumped openly degrades the quality of the land and invites the disease carrying organisms like rodents, insects, etc. they spread diseases like plague, malaria, dengue.

<p><b>Duties of a responsible citizen to preserve land:-</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Create awareness in oneself and even others especially, in his / her family.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 The waste material, especially non-biodegradable substances must not be dumped openly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 The waste must be not dumped openly. It must be treated properly before discharging.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Mining, deforestation, overgrazing must be prevented. This degrades the land and creates desert like situations.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Chemical based fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides must not be used. They not only degrade the land quality but also make the land addicted to these substances. It is harmful for other organisms also.

<h3><p>STRESS ON RESOURCES</h3>

<p>There is much stress on resources in today-s world. Man is using each and every resource in his own way by misusing / overusing the resources. He is not concerned about other creature on earth.
<p>This is resulted by various causes. Such as:-
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>Overpopulation</u>. Population of the whole world is increasing day-by-day. Its effects are seen very frequently. There is a scarcity of pure material. Rates of all products have gone high. There is pressure on almost all sources and resources - air, water, land, minerals and food. Everybody is trying to gain more and more.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>More knowledge</u>. Man is gaining more and more knowledge about his surroundings. He is using his knowledge in the wrong way and exploiting the natural resources. He is taking everything from nature in a quantity more than needed. New technologies have come which are useful for man but are proving fatal to nature. In this way man is using his brain to destroy himself.
