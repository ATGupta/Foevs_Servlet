<h2 style="text-align: center">DISRUPTION OF NUTRIENT CYCLES AND HABITATS</h2>

<p>Pollution is the main cause of disruption of nutrient cycles and habitats. Let's discuss how.

<p><b>Atmospheric / Air pollution: -</b> 
<p>Atmospheric pollution can be defined as the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate matter, or biological material that are harmful to humans or other living organisms and damaging the environment. The main polluter of the Earth's atmosphere is man.

<p><b>CAUSES OF AIR POLLUTION: -</b> 

<p><b>Anthropogenic sources (human activity) which cause air pollution</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 "Stationary Sources" include smoke stacks of power plants, manufacturing facilities (factories) and waste incinerators, as well as furnaces and other types of fuel-burning heating devices. In developing and poor countries, traditional biomass burning is the major source of air pollutants; traditional biomass includes wood, crop waste and dung.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 "Mobile Sources" include motor vehicles, marine vessels, aircraft and the effect of sound etc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Chemicals, dust and controlled burn practices in agriculture and forestry management. Fumes from paint, hair spray, varnish, aerosol sprays and other solvents
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Waste deposition in landfills, which generate methane. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Military, such as nuclear weapons, toxic gases, germ warfare and rocketry

<p><b>Natural sources of air pollution</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Dust from natural sources, usually large areas of land with little or no vegetation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Methane, emitted by the digestion of food by animals, for example cattle
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Radon gas from radioactive decay within the Earth's crust. Smoke and carbon monoxide from wildfires
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Vegetation, in some regions, emits environmentally significant amounts of VOCs on warmer days. These VOCs react with primary anthropogenic pollutants-specifically, NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and anthropogenic organic carbon compounds-to produce a seasonal haze of secondary pollutants.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Volcanic activity, which produce sulfur, chlorine, and ash particulates

<p><b>Human activities that affect biological cycles and their effects: -</b>
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.slideshare.net/mccracken/ecological-cycles)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Hydrological cycle: - 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Withdrawing large amounts of freshwater.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Clearing vegetation and eroding soil
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Polluting surface and underground water.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Carbon Cycle: -
<br>By adding access of CO2 into atmosphere through: -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Burning fossil fuels
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Clearing vegetation faster than it is replaced

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Nitrogen Cycle: -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Adding gases that contribute to acid rain
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Adding Nitrous Oxide to the atmosphere through farming practices which can warm the atmosphere and deplete ozone.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Contaminating ground water from nitrate ions in inorganic fertilizers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Releasing nitrogen into the troposphere through deforestation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Use of fertilizers fix more nitrogen than all the sources combined

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Phosphorus Cycles: -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 We remove large amounts of phosphates from earth to make fertilizers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 We reduce phosphorus in tropical soils by deforestation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 We add excess of phosphates to aquatic systems from runoff of animal wastes and fertilizers.

<p><b>Connection between pollution and development: -</b>
<p>We can clearly observe from our environment that development can be done, but is not actually being done, without pollution. For example, we can use solar cells, wind turbines to produce energy instead of burning fossil fuels. But we are using more and more automobiles and cutting forests to obtain agricultural and infrastructural lands.
<p>But if pollution is there, we can get no benefit of any type of development. We can develop up to heights imaginary, but we ultimately have to return to the alternatives. This is because pollution is the main hazard for the organisms of now-a-days and to experience the development, we have to at least live, that too a healthy life.
<p>No one can go beyond nature. If we break nature's rules, we have to suffer. If we exploit nature's resources, we have to pay for it, and actually, we are!

<p><b>Local and global effects of atmospheric pollution: -</b>
<p>Atmospheric pollution is such a pollution which spreads over vast time and volume. For example, air pollution at India will also affect the air of Germany or France. So, air pollution locally results to global effects as it is a global problem, occurring everywhere.
<p>Generally if you are young and in a good state of health, moderate air pollution levels are unlikely to have any serious short term effects. However, elevated levels and/or long term exposure to air pollution can lead to more serious symptoms and conditions affecting human health. This mainly affects the respiratory and inflammatory systems, but can also lead to more serious conditions such as heart disease and cancer. People with lung or heart conditions may be more susceptible to the effects of air pollution.

<p>The table below shows the types of health effects experienced by the most common pollutants at elevated levels: - 

<table border=1 style="margin-right: 100px;margin-left: 100px;border-collapse:collapse">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Pollutant</th>
			<th>Health effects at very high levels</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Ozone</td>
			<td>These gases irritate the airways of the lungs, increasing the symptoms of those suffering from lung diseases</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Particles</td>
			<td>Fine particles can be carried deep into the lungs where they can cause inflammation and a worsening of heart and lung diseases</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Carbon Monoxide</td>
			<td>This gas prevents the uptake of oxygen by the blood. This can lead to a significant reduction in the supply of oxygen to the heart, particularly in people suffering from heart disease</td>

<p><b>Greenhouse effect: -</b> 
<p>Pollutant gases like 
CO<sub>2</sub>,
SO<sub>2</sub>, 
NO<sub>x</sub>
 and others trap the sun's heat which fall on earth and make its surface warmer. This is called greenhouse effect.
<p>But due to atmospheric pollution, the quantity of these gases is increasing day-by-day and thus earth's temperature is also increasing. This has become a severe problem of today's world.

<p><b>Effects of greenhouse effect on or mother earth: -</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 more drought and more flooding
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 less ice and snow
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 more extreme weather incidents
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 rising sea level
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.bgs.ac.uk/discoveringGeology/climateChange/CCS/consequencesOfTemperatureIncrease.html)
<p>Actually, if there were no global warming on Earth, it would be so cool that life would not be possible on it.

<p><b>Ozone depletion: -</b> 
<p>The fact that the ozone layer was being depleted was discovered in the mid-1980s.  The main cause of this is the release of CFCs, chlorofluorocarbons.
<p>Antarctica was an early victim of ozone destruction.  A massive hole in the ozone layer right above Antarctica now threatens not only that continent, but many others that could be the victims of Antarctica's melting icecaps.  In the future, the ozone problem will have to be solved so that the protective layer can be conserved.

<p><b>Effects of ozone depletion-</b>
<p>Every time 1% of the ozone layer is depleted, 2% more UV-B is able to reach the surface of the planet.  UV-B increase is one of the most harmful consequences of ozone depletion because it can cause skin cancer.
<p>The increased cancer levels caused by exposure to this ultraviolet light could be enormous.  The EPA estimates that 60 million Americans born by the year 2075 will get skin cancer because of ozone depletion.  About one million of these people will die. 
<p>In addition to cancer, some research shows that a decreased ozone layer will increase rates of malaria and other infectious diseases.  According to the EPA, 17 million more cases of cataracts can also be expected.
<p>The environment will also be negatively affected by ozone depletion.  The life cycles of plants will change, disrupting the food chain.  Effects on animals will also be severe, and are very difficult to foresee.
<p>Oceans will be hit hard as well.  The most basic microscopic organisms such as plankton may not be able to survive.  If that happened, it would mean that all of the other animals that are above plankton in the food chain would also die out.  Other ecosystems such as forests and deserts will also be harmed.
<p>The planet's climate could also be affected by depletion of the ozone layer.  Wind patterns could change, resulting in climatic changes throughout the world.

<p><b>Burning of fossil fuel products: -</b> 
<p>The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion tonnes (21.3 gigatonnes) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year (one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide). Carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that enhances radiative forcing and contributes to global warming, causing the average surface temperature of the Earth to rise in response, which the vast majority of climate scientists agree will cause major adverse effects.
