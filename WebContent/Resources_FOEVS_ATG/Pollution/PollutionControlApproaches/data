<p><b>Techniques frequently used: -</b> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Removal of particulate matter: -</b> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Cyclone Separators</u>: - 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Centrifugal collectors use cyclonic action to separate dust particles from the gas stream. In a typical cyclone, the dust gas stream enters at an angle and is spun rapidly. The centrifugal force created by the circular flow throws the dust particles toward the wall of the cyclone. After striking the wall, these particles fall into a hopper located underneath.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two types: - 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single Cyclone Separators
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple Cyclone Separators

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Electrostatic Precipitators: -</u> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An electrostatic precipitator (ESP), or electrostatic air cleaner is a particulate collection device that removes particles from a flowing gas (such as air) using the force of an induced electrostatic charge. Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine particulate matter such as dust and smoke from the air stream. In contrast to wet scrubbers which apply energy directly to the flowing fluid medium, an ESP applies energy only to the particulate matter being collected and therefore is very efficient in its consumption of energy (in the form of electricity).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Removal of gaseous pollutants: -</b> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Wet Dry System - Scrubber: - </u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scrubber systems are a diverse group of air pollution control devices that can be used to remove some particulates and/or gases from industrial exhaust streams.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a device that employs spray of water to catch pollutants during emissions. A dry scrubber is used to remove acidic gases. The process of removing pollutants includes spraying of wet lime powder into the hot exhaust chamber. The scrubber uses this lime to neutralize acid gases.

<p><b>Combating Global Warming: -</b> 
<br>[combating = opposing, fighting against]
<p><u>Green Automobiles / Green Vehicles: -</u> 
<p>[A green vehicle or environmentally friendly vehicle is a road motor vehicle that produces less harmful impacts to the environment than comparable conventional internal combustion engine vehicles running on gasoline or diesel, or one that uses certain alternative fuels.
<p>Green vehicles can be powered by alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies and include hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, battery electric vehicles, compressed-air vehicles, hydrogen and fuel-cell vehicles, neat ethanol vehicles, flexible-fuel vehicles, natural gas vehicles, clean diesel vehicles, and some sources also include vehicles using blends of biodiesel and ethanol fuel or gasohol.]

<p>In India, the passenger car segment led the way among the entire automobile segment and was the only segment to get three leaves. Mass transport vehicle segment came in second, which performed better due to introduction of CNG fuelled vehicles. The two and three wheeler segment, with two leaves, lagged behind. This was the result of rating done by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), India. 
<p>In terms of overall performance, the three companies, which topped the environmental rating, were Daewoo Motor India Ltd., Hyundai Motors India Ltd. and General Motors India. All these three companies performed well in product usage phase. 
<p>The companies, at the bottom of the pile, were the three non-participating companies, Bajaj Tempo Ltd., Yamaha Motor Escort Ltd. and Swaraj Mazda Ltd.

<p><b>Green technology: -</b> 
<br>[Green technology is basically the application of the environmental sciences to preserve the natural environment and resources.]
<p>It would be wrong to state that clean technology is a fresh thing. Not only the awareness about clean tech has reached people, the understanding of saving the dire state the planet has also been infused within the society. Various campaigns and promotions have been conducted by numerous 'environment saving societies' from time to time to inform people about its significance and importance to humankind. The continuous efforts have successfully resulted in the delegation of enormous resources to the research and development of cleaner technologies which eventually boosts the anticipation for much better advancements on the mentioned field.

<p><b>Problems related to combating global warming: -</b> 

<p><u>Lack of international cooperation</u>: - 
<p>International cooperation is a must to combat global warming. Some Governments (notably EU members) argue the need for internationally coordinated policies. Others say it would be more cost-efficient to allow each country to adopt the policies and measures best suited to its national circumstances.

<p><u>Long term issue</u>: - 
<p>Off course combating global warming is a long term issue. It will take a long time on a mission of a world free of global warming. Its essential features are that current economic activity has large-scale long-term future consequences on both environmental amenities and the capacity to provide material well-being.

<p><u>Effect not uniform</u>: - 
<p>For example, if there is no pollution in Nagariya, a village of India, near my house, off course its air will be affected because of the air pollution occurring around the world.

<p><u>Impact on lifestyle and economy</u>: - 
<p>For example, people have to reduce or forbid the use of vehicles (impact on life style). The industries may also suffer a lot because a lot of air pollution is done by industries only (impact on economy). The fastness of life of now-a-days will reduce.

<p><b>International political dimensions: -</b> 
<p>Both climate change and policies to minimize its effects have enormous environmental and economic implications. The costs of climate change will vary widely from country to country. Developed countries are responsible for over two thirds of past emissions and some 75 per cent of current emissions, but they are best positioned to protect themselves from damage. Developing countries tend to have low per capita emissions, are in great need of economic development and are more vulnerable to climate-change impacts.

<p>These differences have helped to shape the positions that Governments take in international talks. The key players are: - 
<p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>The European Union.</u> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to environmental concerns, the EU played a leading role in launching the Convention negotiations. In general, the EU supported binding targets and timetables for emissions reduction. Other countries did not agree, and these were not included in the treaty.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>The JUSSCANZ countries.</u> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the non-EU developed countries--including Japan, the United States, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Norway. The non-European members of this group tend to share a concern for a more "flexible" approach to limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The United States in particular played a key role in the drafting of article 4.2, on developed-country commitments to limit emissions. Despite what has been called the "creative ambiguity" of the final text, it is almost universally interpreted as committing developed countries to make a sincere effort to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. When the Clinton Administration came into office in 1993, it softened the United States line and explicitly announced the US intention to pursue stabilization.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>Countries with economies in transition.</u> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The industrialized countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are significant emitters of greenhouse gases. However, due to the economic slump following the end of communism, they will likely succeed in keeping their emissions below 1990 levels through 2000. Afterwards, however, their economies and emissions levels are expected to revive.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>The Group of 77 and China.</u> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developing countries work through the Group of 77 to develop common positions on emissions-reduction commitments and financial and technological transfers. However, the G77 does not always present a united front, owing to the widely differing interests of its members. For example, China and others have enormous coal resources that are vital to their economic development. African countries tend to focus on vulnerability and impacts. Many of the Asian economic "tigers" have concerns about the possibility of being the next in line for emissions-reduction targets. Countries with large forestry sectors are sensitive to the implications of developing forests as carbon "sinks". 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>The Association of Small Island States.</u> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AOSIS countries played a prominent role in galvanizing support for the Convention. They are particularly vulnerable to the risk of sea-level rise and therefore strongly support rapid action to reduce emissions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</u> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OPEC members tend to be concerned about the likely impact on their economies if other countries reduce their use of oil. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and others have emphasized the existence of scientific uncertainty and argued that the convention process should move forward cautiously.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>Business.</u> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first business groups to attend the climate talks as observers represented energy-intensive firms concerned about the negative economic implications of a convention. More recently, other business sectors have started to follow the process more closely, including the insurance sector, which sees itself as vulnerable to increased storms and other possible climate change impacts, and clean energy firms that see market opportunities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>Environmentalists.</u> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Green groups have been active in the climate change arena since the very beginning. Many are active in lobbying delegates and the media and produce newsletters during international meetings. The majority are from developed countries, although constant efforts are made to promote the participation of more non-governmental organizations from developing countries.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>Local authorities.</u> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many cities around the world have launched climate change plans that are even more ambitious than those of their national Governments. Urban governments are critically important because of their role in managing energy utilities, public transport and other emissions-producing activities of the public sector. Mayors and other urban leaders have joined together in an association to present their views at Convention-related meetings.
