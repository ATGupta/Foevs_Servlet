<h2 style="text-align: center">SOIL POLLUTION</h2>

<p>Soil pollution is caused by the presence of xenobiotic (human-made) chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment. It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals, or improper disposal of waste.

<p><b>What Causes Soil Pollution?</b>
<p>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Industrial wastes such as harmful gases and chemicals, agricultural pesticides, fertilizers and insecticides are the most common causes of soil pollution.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Ignorance towards soil management and related systems.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Unfavorable and harmful irrigation practices.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Improper septic system and management and maintenance of the same.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Leakages from sanitary sewage.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Acid rains, when fumes released from industries get mixed with rains.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Fuel leakages from automobiles, that get washed away due to rain and seep into the nearby soil.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Unhealthy waste management techniques, which are characterized by release of sewage into the large dumping grounds and nearby streams or rivers.

<p><b>What are the Effects of Soil Pollution?</b>
<p>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Decrease in soil fertility and therefore decrease in the soil yield. How can one expect contaminated soil to produce healthy crops?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Loss of soil and natural nutrients present in it. Plants also would not thrive in such soil, which would further result in soil erosion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Disturbance in the balance of flora and fauna residing in the soil.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Increase in salinity of the soil, which therefore makes it unfit for vegetation, thus making it useless and barren.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Generally crops cannot grow and flourish in polluted soil. Yet, if some crops manage to grow, they would be poisonous enough to cause serious health problems in people consuming them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Creation of toxic dust is another potential effect of soil pollution.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Foul smell due to industrial chemicals and gases might result in headaches, fatigue, nausea, etc., in many people.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Soil pollutants would bring in alteration in the soil structure, which would lead to death of many essential organisms in it. This would also affect the larger predators and compel them to move to other places, once they lose their food supply.
