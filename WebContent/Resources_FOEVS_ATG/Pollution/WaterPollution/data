<h2 style="text-align: center">WATER POLLUTION</h2>

<p>Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies (e.g. Lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and ground water).Water pollution occurs when pollutants are discharged directly or indirectly into water bodies without adequate treatment to remove harmful compounds.
<p>Water pollution affects plants and organisms living in these bodies of water. In almost all cases the effect is damaging not only to individual species and populations, but also to the natural biological communities.

<p><b>Water Cycle: -</b> 
<p>Also called hydrological cycle. Can be explained better with the help of the diagrammatic picture below.

<h3><p>Groundwater Pollution: -</h3> 
<p>Water markets thriving on groundwater has become a lucrative business for all those ranging from the private suppliers selling water, water tankers and the big bottled water companies. This over extraction has found rapid depletion of water tables as well as deterioration of water quality in most of the cities.
<p>Groundwater in the cities is contaminated with fluoride and nitrate and is unfit for drinking without treatment. Higher rates of groundwater extraction in coastal areas have also led to salinity intrusion in coastal aquifers, especially in Tamil Nadu and Gujrat. Thus unplanned and uncontrolled extraction of groundwater has disturbed the hydrological balance.

<p><b>Effects of groundwater pollution: -</b> 
<p>Human infectious disease is one of the more serious effects of water pollution especially in rural countries that are still developing and where sanitation is rarely present. This alone could cause hundreds of thousands of sicknesses in the area contaminated. Not only is drinking water a problem but so is swimming water.
<p>Not only are we affected by water pollution but so are animals around us. Nutrient pollution is the most widespread problem. The presence of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients that come may come from groundwater pollution can turn the area into coastal zone which means it can stimulate harmful overgrowths of algae, can have direct toxic effects and result in low-oxygen conditions.  Some algae are toxic and zooplanktons eat them causing the pollution to go through the food chain and eventually harming use with sickness or even death.

<p><b>Difficulty in dealing with groundwater pollution: -</b> 
<p>In-situ purifying of ground water is very difficult and expensive. 

<h3><p>SURFACE WATER POLLUTION: -</h3> 
<p>Surface waters are the natural water resources of the Earth. They are found on the exterior of the Earth’s crust and include: - 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Oceans
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Rivers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Lakes
<p>These waters can become polluted in a number of ways, and this is called surface water pollution.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.water-pollution.org.uk/surface.html)

<p><b>Source of surface water pollution: -</b> 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Improper use of fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Improperly built or poorly located and/or maintained septic systems
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Leaking or abandoned underground storage tanks and piping
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Stormwater drains
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Improper disposal or storage of wastes/hazardous materials
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.lakecountyfl.gov/departments/public_works/environmental_services/water_quality_lab/ground_and_surface_water_pollution.aspx)

<p><b>Effects of surface water pollution: -</b> 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Agricultural waste increases the concentration of agro-based chemicals. This acts as a food for the microscopic organisms and ultimately the oxygen level goes down.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Oil spills cut off the oxygen supply to the waterbodies affected and the aquatic animals die.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 The amount of portable water reduces. If the contaminated water is used in drinking, it can result into hazardous diseases.

<h3><p>OCEAN POLLUTION</h3> 

<p><b>Causes of ocean pollution</b>
<p>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Accidental and deliberate discharge of crude oil into the ocean by cargo ships is regarded as one of the prime causes of pollution of the water body.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Dumping of industrial wastes into ocean is another reason for marine pollution. The wastes often contain toxic materials such as mercury, dioxin, PCBs, PAHs and radioactive materials, which contaminate the water of ocean.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Deposition of sediments from mining leads to ocean pollution.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Trash washed into the ocean after heavy rain or floods gives rise to marine debris, which pollutes the water body.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Dumping of human wastes, plastic and disposal of untreated or partially treated sewage water into the ocean is called 'garbage dumping'. This is one of the leading causes of marine pollution.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Carbon dioxide, emitted by automobiles, due to the burning of fossil fuels, leads to air pollution. The contaminated air containing carbon dioxide reaches the ocean in the form of acid rain, thereby polluting the water.

<p><b>Effects of ocean pollution</b>
<p>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Oil spilling is hazardous for the marine life. It seriously affects the life cycle of coral reefs thriving in the ocean. The oil spilled in the ocean could clog up the gills of fishes, thereby preventing respiration. It affects the process of photosynthesis of marine plants, since it blocks the sunlight.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Toxic wastes have direct effect on marine life and affect the human beings indirectly. When the harmful toxic wastes are dumped into the ocean, the fishes could consume the poisonous chemicals. When the fish is eaten by humans, this could lead to food poisoning.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Dumping of garbage into ocean can deplete the oxygen dissolved in water. As a result, the health of marine life is affected seriously. Due to lack of oxygen, the sea animals including whales, seals, herrings, dolphins, penguins and sharks could perish.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Carbon dioxide is hazardous for marine life including coral reefs and free-swimming algae.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Plastics dumped into ocean can affect the marine life seriously. Plastic items such as bottles and bags could choke and suffocate the sea animals, as they eat them thinking that they are food. Plastics are known to be a major cause for the death of turtles, as they swallow the floating bags, mistaking them for jelly fish.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Dumping of industrial wastes such as pesticides, especially DDT, can accumulate in the fatty tissue of animals. This could lead to the failure in the reproductive system of mammals and birds.

<h3><p>INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION</h3> 
<p>Some industrial facilities generate ordinary domestic sewage that can be treated by municipal facilities. Industries that generate wastewater with high concentrations of conventional pollutants (e.g. oil and grease), toxic pollutants (e.g. heavy metals, volatile organic compounds) or other nonconventional pollutants such as ammonia, need specialized treatment systems. Some of these facilities can install a pre-treatment system to remove the toxic components, and then send the partially treated wastewater to the municipal system. Industries generating large volumes of wastewater typically operate their own complete on-site treatment systems.

<p><b>Effects of water pollution due to industries: -</b> 
<p style="text-align: right">(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution)
<p><b>Radioactive Pollution: -</b> 
<p>
<br>Early hatching of fish eggs
<br>Failure to spawn
<br>Decrease in species diversity
<br>Migration of aquatic forms 
<br>Rest all causes are same as surface water pollution. 

<p><b>Domestic sewage: -</b> 
<p>Domestic sewage is 99.9 percent pure water, while the other 0.1 percent are pollutants. Although found in low concentrations, these pollutants pose risk on a large scale. In urban areas, domestic sewage is typically treated by centralized sewage treatment plants.

<p><b>Treatment of domestic sewage: -</b> 
<p>Cities with sanitary sewer overflows or combined sewer overflows employ one or more engineering approaches to reduce discharges of untreated sewage, including:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Utilizing a green infrastructure approach to improve stormwater management capacity throughout the system, and reduce the hydraulic overloading of the treatment plant
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Repair and replacement of leaking and malfunctioning equipment
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Increasing overall hydraulic capacity of the sewage collection system (often a very expensive option)
<p>A household or business not served by a municipal treatment plant may have an individual septic tank, which treats the wastewater on site and discharges into the soil. Alternatively, domestic wastewater may be sent to a nearby privately owned treatment system (e.g. in a rural community).

<p><b>Marine Ecosystem and Coastal Zone Protection: -</b> 
<p>India has a vast extent of coast line of about 8129 km and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of 2.02 million km2, which are home to a diversity of coastal and marine ecosystems, comprising nationally and globally significant biodiversity rich areas. India’s wealth of biodiversity is found in highly diverse marine and coastal habitats. Until today marine diversity is less known than terrestrial biodiversity due to the logistic difficulties of explorations, underwater surveys and collections. Oceans support a large human population in India directly and indirectly.
<p style="text-align: right">((http://www.ndc.nic.in/pdf/topics/MARINE_BIOLOGICAL_RESOURCES_OF_INDIA_AN_OVER_VIEW.pdf)

<p><b>Measures taken for protection of marine ecosystem and coastal: -</b> 
<p>The Wild Life Protection Act of India (1972) provides legal protection to many marine animals. Chapter IV of this Act dealing with sanctuaries, national parks, game reserves and closed areas is applicable to Marine reserves and biospheres also. A National Committee on mangroves, wetlands and coral reefs was constituted in 1993 with a mandate to advise the government on relevant policies and programs. The mangrove and coral reef areas were declared as ecologically sensitive areas under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The Coastal Regulation zone (CRZ) notification came in 1991 prohibiting developmental activities and disposal of wastes in the fragile coastal ecosystems. Some of the national parks and sanctuaries in India were declared exclusively as marine protected areas in the 1980s and 1990s. There are a total of 31 major marine protected areas in India. They cover coastal wetlands, especially mangroves, coral reefs and lagoons and have been notified under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
<p>The country took one more step ahead with the promulgation of the Biological Diversity Act of India2002 and the Biological Diversity Rules 2004. A National Biodiversity Authority with state –level Boards and district-level Management Committees was established under this Act. The main functions of the Authority is to advise the government on matters related to the protection and conservation of biodiversity, sustainable use and equitable sharing of its components, Intellectual Property Rights, etc.
