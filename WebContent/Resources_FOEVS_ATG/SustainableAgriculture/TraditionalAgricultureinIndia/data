<h2 style="text-align: center">TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURE IN INDIA</h2>

<p>Traditional farming is where the farmer has a mixed farm of livestock and crops. The farmer uses manure from the livestock to fertilize the crops and some of the crop to feed the livestock. Farmers of this type operate with the minimum of supplies purchased from outside the farm.
<p>Traditional Indian agricultural systems can be classified into one or more of the following basic categories.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Shifting Cultivation
<br>&#8226 Nomadic Pastoralism
<br>&#8226 Continuous Cultivation
<br>&#8226 Mixed Subsistence Farming

<p>Irrigation systems: - 
<p>Traditional Irrigation systems in India include: -
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 <u>Moat</u>: - 
<br>Moat irrigation system is a manual type of irrigation in which the water is drawn from a well and the plants are irrigated.
<br>&#8226 <u>Chain pump</u>: - 
<br>A chain pump consists of two large wheels, connected by a chain. Buckets are hanged on the chain. The bottom wheel is half immersed in the water source. As the wheel is turned, the buckets dip into the pool and pick up water. The chain then lifts them to the upper wheel, where the water from the buckets is transferred to the pool. The chain then carries the empty buckets back down to be refilled and the process continues.

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 <u>Dhekli</u>: - 
<br>Dhekli is a traditional system of irrigation used in rural regions. In this system, man or woman uses rope and container to obtain water from well for irrigation purpose.
<br>&#8226 <u>Rahat</u>: - 
<br>Rahat is a traditional method of irrigation in which animals like oxen are used to pull out water from the wells. This water is then evenly spread out over the fields. It is cheap but not very efficient method of irrigation.

<p><b>Crop varieties: -</b> 
<p>Based on the use, crops are of 4 major types: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">(1) Food and fodder crops (rice, wheat)
<br>(2) Oilseeds and pulses (moong, arhar, mustard)
<br>(3) Commercial crops (indigo, mentha)
<br>(4) Seeds (almonds, soyabean, groundnut)

<p>Based on the cropping seasons, the crops are of 3 varieties: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">(1) Rabi: - sown - October - December;	harvested - April - June
<br>Wheat, barley, peas, gram, mustard
<br>(2) Kharif: - sown - June;	harvested - September - October
<br>Rice, maize, cotton, moong, urad, soyabean, jowar, bajra, tur, jute, groundnut
<br>(3) Zaid: - between rabi and kharif - a short summer season
<br>Watermelon, muskmelon, cucumber

<p><b>Techniques for maintaining soil fertility: -</b> 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">1. Manuring <i>[adding manure]</i>
<br>2. Compost making <i>[dig a shape of 1m3 in ground, put organic matter, e.g. vegetable waste, allow to rest for a week or more days, add water periodically to maintain moisture, till periodically to aerate the system]</i>
<br>3. Mixed cropping <i>[two or more crops together; the plants help each other to grow]</i>
<br>4. Alley cropping <i>[growing of crops between rows of trees, some of them which can fix nitrogen in the soil]</i>.

<p><b>Impact of colonialism: -</b> 
<p>In India the impact was very little; agriculture in 1947 was not obviously different from in 1647. It has since developed with modern technology a bit and distribution is much better than it was 50 years ago.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061221070112AA9bYCd)

<p><b>Indian agriculture at independence: -</b> 
<p>During the colonial era famines were frequent and famine commissions were abundant. The growth rate in food production during the 1900-1947 periods was hardly 0.1 per cent. Most of the important institutional developments in agriculture emanated from the recommendations of famine commissions. The great Bengal Famine of 1942-43 provided the backdrop to India's Independence.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><b>Food Scarcity: -</b> 
<br>The condition of Indian agriculture was not good. So a problem of food scarcity existed then.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><b>Food import: -</b> 
<br>Soon after Independence, India had begun to seek food aid and in fact emerged as the biggest food importer of this century. In 1951, India got ad hoc assistance of 2 million tonnes of foodgrain to tide over the crisis arising from severe drought in several parts of the country. This was the first major food security on a significant scale after Independence.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><b>Need for increasing production: -</b> 
<br>Not to fall in the debts of other countries for food or being dependent on other countries for food, there was an urgent need to increase food production in India itself. When green revolution came in India in 1963 when HYV wheat was introduced. It increased food production in India in large ratios.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><b>Need for land reforms: -</b> 
<br>There was the existence of rent-receiving parasitic intermediaries between the actual tillers of the soil at the bottom, and the government at the top, great inequity in the ownership of land, concentration of agricultural lands in the hands of the upper classes who shunned physical labor and took little personal interest in farming.

<p><b>Modern agriculture: -</b> Modern agriculture includes the techniques which are used now-a-days. Modern agriculture may refer to:
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Agribusiness
<br>&#8226 Industrial agriculture
<br>&#8226 Intensive farming
<br>&#8226 Organic farming
<br>&#8226 Sustainable agriculture

<p><b>Green revolution: -</b> 
<p>The introduction of high-yielding varieties [HYVs] of seeds and the increased use of fertilizers and irrigation are known collectively as the Green Revolution.
<p>Green revolution was first introduced in India in 1963 by Dr. Norman Borlaug when genetically modified High Yielding Varieties of seeds were introduced.

<p style="text-align: right">(http://actnaturallyblog.wordpress.com/tag/green-revolution/)

<p>Hybrid high-yielding wheat was first introduced to India in 1963 by Dr. Norman Borlaug.
<p>The following measures were adopted: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Use of high yielding varieties (HYV) of seeds
<br>&#8226 Irrigation
<br>&#8226 Use of insecticides and pesticides
<br>&#8226 Consolidation of holdings
<br>&#8226 Land reforms
<br>&#8226 Improved rural infrastructure
<br>&#8226 Supply of agricultural credit
<br>&#8226 Use of (chemical) fertilizers
<br>&#8226 Opening of agriculture colleges
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution_in_India)

<p><b>Critical Appraisal of Green Revolution: -</b> 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">(i) Green revolution increased the annual crop production in India.
<br>(ii) It made food worse than before. Fertilizers, pesticides, and insecticides of now-a-days toxicate food items. They may cause genetic disorders too.
<br>(iii) The use of chemicals kills the insects and microorganisms too which are useful for plant growth.
<br>(iv) The HYV seeds do not give natural taste and nutrients.
<br>(v) The HYV seeds are very sensitive to germs.
<br>(vi) Now-a-days, organic farming is giving better results than inorganic farming.
<br>(vii) Green revolution resulted as a boon for the farmers but a curse for the food consumers.

<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><b>Soil health: -</b>
<p style="margin-left: 200px;">(1) Synthetic nitrogen (of fertilizers) destroys soil carbon, undetermines soil health.
<br>(2) Pesticides and insecticides kill the vital organisms present in the soil too.
<br>(3) HYV seeds and fertilizers increase the soil borne diseases and yields have often declined.

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Ecological impact of pesticides: - 
<p style="margin-left: 200px;">(1) Pesticides move to air, water and soil too.
<br>(2) They deplete the organism population, that too, which is useful in farmlands.
<br>(3) Pesticides go inside plant cells. The consumer's blood gets contaminated. The milk of human mothers is found highly contaminated with pesticides.
<br>(4) It depletes fertility and genetic characters.

<p><b>Energy: -</b> 
<p>Modern agriculture's heavy reliance on petrochemicals and mechanization has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output, causing food shortages. Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides.
<p style="text-align: right">(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture)

<p><b>Ability to reach poorer sections of rural communities: -</b> 
<p>Due to less knowledge and illiteracy, the poorer sections of rural communities in India are not able to avail themselves the sustainable agricultural methods. The government has started various schemes in favor of rural farmers.
<p>Sustainable agriculture growth is crucial for reducing rural poverty.

<p><b>Sustainability: -</b> 
<p>Sustainability is the ability to keep in existence, to supply with necessities, to support, to bear with and to keep up completely.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sustainability)

<p><b>Need for sustainable agriculture: -</b> 
<p>Life on earth is estimated to be around for another ten years, due to the use of neonoctinoids, a type of insecticide which is damaging the navigational skills of the world's biggest pollinator; the honey bee. The bees are also being harmed by the fact the fields these days are so huge and grow only one plant which flowers for a couple of weeks, meaning the rest of the time the bees cannot get enough food, so they die.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_need_for_sustainable_agriculture)

<p>There are many other factors of inorganic farming (chemical farming) discussed before which are just harms and nothing else - poisoning of food, infertility of soil, death of useful insects and organisms. So what we need is just sustainable agriculture which we can attain only by organic ways / methods.
<p>Characteristics of sustainable agriculture: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 <u>Conservation and preservation</u>. 
<br>What is taken out of the environment is put back in, so land and resources such as water, soil, and air are available to future generations. The waste from sustainable farming stays within the farm's ecosystem and cannot cause buildup or pollution. In addition, sustainable agriculture seeks to minimize transportation costs and fossil fuel use, and is as such locally-based.
<br>&#8226 <u>Biodiversity</u>. 
<br>Farms raise different types of plants and animals, which are rotated around the fields to enrich the soil and help prevent disease and pest outbreaks. Chemical pesticides are used minimally and only when necessary; many sustainable farms do not use any form of chemicals.
<br>&#8226 <u>Animal welfare</u>. 
<br>Animals are treated humanely and with respect, and are well cared for. They are permitted to carry out their natural behaviors, such as grazing, rooting or pecking, and are fed a natural diet.
<br>&#8226 <u>Economically viable</u>. 
<br>Farmers are paid a fair wage and are not dependent on subsidies from the government. Sustainable farmers help strengthen rural communities.
<br>&#8226 <u>Socially just</u>. 
<br>Workers are treated fairly and paid competitive wages and benefits. They work in a safe environment and are offered proper living conditions and food.

<p><b>Natural Farming: -</b> 
<p>Natural farming is an ecological farming approach established by Masanobu Fukuoka (1913-2008), a Japanese farmer and philosopher who described his way of farming as 自然農法 (shizen n&#245;h&#245;) in Japanese. It is also referred to as "the Fukuoka Method", "the natural way of farming" or "do-nothing farming". 
<p>Masanobu Fukuoka is a farmer/philosopher who lives on the Island of Shikoku, in southern Japan. His farming technique requires no machines, no chemicals and very little weeding. He does not plow the soil or use prepared compost and yet the condition of the soil in his orchards and fields improve each year. His method creates no pollution and does not require fossil fuels. His method requires less labor than any other, yet the yields in his orchard and fields compare favorably with the most productive Japanese farms which use all the technical know-how of modern science.

<p><b>Organic agriculture: -</b> 
<p>Organic agriculture is also known as organic farming. It is the form of agriculture that relies on techniques such as crop rotation, green manure, compost and biological pest control.
<p>Organic agriculture is a holistic production management system which promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It emphasises the use of management practices in preference to the use of off-farm inputs, taking into account that regional conditions require locally adapted systems. This is accomplished by using, where possible, agronomic, biological, and mechanical methods, as opposed to using synthetic materials, to fulfil any specific function within the system.
<p>Organic farming system in India is not new and is being followed from ancient time. It is a method of farming system which primarily aimed at cultivating the land and raising crops in such a way, as to keep the soil alive and in good health by use of organic wastes (crop, animal and farm wastes, aquatic wastes) and other biological materials along with beneficial microbes (biofertilizers) to release nutrients to crops for increased sustainable production in an eco-friendly pollution free environment.
