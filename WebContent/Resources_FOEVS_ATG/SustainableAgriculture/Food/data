<h2 style="text-align: center">FOOD</h2>

<p><b>The twin problems of production and access: -</b> the Indian population of humans was 357.4 million in 1951. It had been rising continuously and now, the 2011 census tells us that the human population is some 1.21 billion. The area of land sown is 234 million acres but of this, some 44 million acres carry 2 or more crops a year so that the actual area of crop is 278 million acres. If we calculate per head, the land area would come less than 0.8 acres in 1951 and now, it would come less than 0.0023 acres. Farming land is not spread in the ratio in which population rose.
<p>So, there is a major problem of food production, in India, which is less than wanted. And all people cannot access proper food.

<p><b>Food situation in the world: -</b> 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">(1) The poor people of the world now have more adequate diets than at any other time in this century. The poor people of the world will have somewhat more adequate diets by the end of this century than they now have.
<br>(2) The potential expansion of food production by the end of this century is significantly greater than that will be achieved with a continuation of existing governmental policies; resources, both natural and human, are adequate for a significant increase in the rate of growth of food production.
<br>(3) Much of the instability of food prices that we have witnessed during the 1970s-the high prices of 1973 and 1974 and low prices of today-has resulted from governmental policies (the acts of man) and not primarily from instability of production.
<br>(4) The rebuilding of world grain stocks, the low international prices for grains and sugar and the recent increases in per capita food production in most developing countries will mean (has meant) that little additional effort will be made to more nearly realize the potentials that exist for expanding the food production and availability in the developing countries.

<p><b>Integrated and sustained efforts to food security for the third world: -</b> 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">1. Steps taken by government to reduce food prices.
<br>2. Literacy. It will help people find better jobs and they will not starve in hunger.
<br>3. Everyone should keep at least one day fast in a month. This will save millions of tonnes of food every month in India itself.
<br>4. Following sustainable agriculture methods.
<br>5. Awareness. It will give knowledge to the people about the present problems and they can understand their causes.
<p>Already, the Food Security Bill has been proposed by in the parliament of India. It includes the Right to Food Act.
