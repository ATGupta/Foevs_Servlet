<h2 style="text-align: center">NATURAL CAPITAL REGENERATION</h2>

<p>Regeneration of stocks of natural resources is natural capital regeneration.
<p>The natural capital was not taken into account earlier as the population was negligible relative to the environmental resources used. So, natural capital regeneration was either automatic or pr√©cised as unimportant because it was not a limiting factor.
<p>Between 1950 and 1986, world population doubled and most resources consumptions reached new heights. And thus the humanely directed flows of matter and energy rivaled in magnitude to the regenerative capacity of the natural socks. Therefore, while in the past, the limiting factor in economic development was man-made capital.
<p>We are now entering an era in which limiting factor would be the remaining natural capital. And as this remaining natural capital is very much depleted already, the older system of development cannot be adopted by developing countries like India.
