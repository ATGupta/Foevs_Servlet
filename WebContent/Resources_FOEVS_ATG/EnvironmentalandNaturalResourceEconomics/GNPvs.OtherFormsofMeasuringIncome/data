<h2 style="text-align: center">GNP VS OTHER FORMS OF MEASURING INCOME</h2>
<p><i>[GNP = Gross National Product]
<br>[GDP = Gross Domestic Product]</i>

<p>There are 2 main types of measuring income - GNP & GDP.
<p>GNP is the market value of all products and services produced in one year by labor and property supplied by the residents of a country. Unlike GDP, which defines production based on the geographical location of production, GNP allocates production based on ownership.
<p>GNP is often contrasted with GDP. While GNP measures the output generated by a country's enterprises (whether physically located domestically or abroad) GDP measures the total output produced within a country's borders - whether produced by that country's own local firms or by foreign firms.
<p>When a country's capital or labor resources are employed outside its borders, or when a foreign firm is operating in its territory, GDP and GNP can produce different measures of total output.
<p>In 2009 for instance, the United States estimated its
<br>GDP at $14.119 trillion, and
<br>GNP at $14.265 trillion.

<p><b>Advantages of GDP / GNP as an indicator: -</b> 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 A useful figure for comparing countries. Often used to rank countries to establish a fair system of aid payments.
<br>&#8226 Is a good indicator of the state of the economy and provision of services.
<br>&#8226 Fairly easy to calculate from official government figures.
Disadvantages of GDP / GNP as an indicator: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Can hide inequalities as it does not show the distribution of wealth.
<br>&#8226 Can be manipulated by governments who want to appear poor to collect more aid.
<br>&#8226 Does not take into account subsistence or informal economies which are very important in less developed countries.

<p>Other forms of measuring income are: - 

<p><b>NNP [Net National Product]: -<b> 
<p>The monetary value of finished goods and services produced by a country's citizens, whether overseas or resident, in the time period being measured (i.e., GNP) minus the amount of GNP required to purchase new goods to maintain existing stock (i.e., depreciation).
<p>In other words,
<br>NNP is the amount of goods that can be consumed within a nation each year without reducing the amount that can be consumed in following years.
<p style="text-align: center"><b>NNP = total payroll compensation + net indirect tax on current production + operating surpluses.</b>

<p><b>WPI [Wholesale Price Index]: -</b> 
<p>WPI is an index that measures and tracks the changes in price of goods in the stages before the retail level. Wholesale price indexes (WPIs) report monthly to show the average price changes of goods sold in bulk.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wpi.asp)

<p><b>CPI [Consumer Price Index]: -</b> 
<p>CPI measures changes in the price level of consumer goods and services purchased by households.

<p><b>BOP [Balance Of Payments]: -</b> 
<p>A record of all transactions made between one particular country and all other countries during a specified period of time. BOP compares the dollar difference of the amount of exports and imports, including all financial exports and imports. A negative balance of payments means that more money is flowing out of the country than coming in, and vice versa.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bop.asp#axzz25ltnprkM)

<p><b>Inflation: -</b> 
<p>The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and, subsequently, purchasing power is falling. Central banks attempt to stop severe inflation, along with severe deflation, in an attempt to keep the excessive growth of prices to a minimum.
