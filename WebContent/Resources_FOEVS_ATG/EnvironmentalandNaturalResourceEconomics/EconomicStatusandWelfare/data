<p><b>Net Economic Welfare: -</b> 
<p>Net Economic Welfare is a proposed national income measure that attempts to put a value on the costs of pollution, crime, congestion, and other 'negative' spinoffs, in order to find a better measure of true national income.
<p>Net Economic Welfare is the concept of a broader measure of economic welfare than income per head. This could include in addition to ordinary measures of income items such as the following: -
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">1. The cost of effort;
<br>2. The value of household production, including services such as childcare and looking after the sick and elderly;
<br>3. Any depletion of the stock of natural resources;
<br>4. The value of changes in the natural environment.
<p>While such a measure of overall welfare would be of great interest, the observation and valuation of the components is so difficult that any proposed measure would remain highly subjective.
