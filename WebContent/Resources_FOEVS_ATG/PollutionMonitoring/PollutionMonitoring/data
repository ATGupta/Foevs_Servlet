<p>We use coal and radioactive materials for power generation.
<p>Besides this, we are cutting trees and forests which clean the environment to a high extent and prevent various natural calamities. And now, human population is rising. Rising human population results in rising pollution.
<p>So there is a high need to control pollution. It can be done by using alternative of the materials whose use release environmental pollutants.
<p>For example, use of CNG vehicles against petrol and diesel ones.

<p><b>Importance of monitoring air Pollution: -</b> 
<p>Think for some time, we can live without water for 1, 2 or 3 days and without food for 10-15 days but we can't even live for 2-3 minutes without air or you can say oxygen. So think the thing which is that much necessary that we can't live without it for 2-3 minutes. We know it is necessary to inhale clean oxygen.
<p>So it is necessary to monitor air pollution so that we can get the information of the atmosphere we live in and what we actually breathe so that we can act wisely to our caretaker - Nature.

<p><b>Ambient air quality monitoring: -</b> 
<p>Ambient Monitoring is the systematic, long-term assessment of pollutant levels by measuring the quantity and types of certain pollutants in the surrounding, outdoor air.
<p>Emissions Measurement is the process of monitoring particulate and gaseous emissions from a specific source.
