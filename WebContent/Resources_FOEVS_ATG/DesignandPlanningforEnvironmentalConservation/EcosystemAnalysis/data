<h2 style="text-align: center">ECOSYSTEM ANALYSIS</h2>

<p>Ecosystem analysis is detailed study of an ecosystem carried out to ascertain its features from the point of view of its soil composition, energy flux, biogeochemical cycles, biomass, organisms and their relationship with the environment.
<p>An ecosystem is a complete community of living organisms and the nonliving materials of their surroundings. Thus, its components include plants, animals, and microorganisms; soil, rocks, and minerals; as well as surrounding water sources and the local atmosphere. The size of ecosystems varies tremendously. An ecosystem could be an entire rain forest, covering a geographical area larger than many nations, or it could be a puddle or a backyard garden. Even the body of an animal could be considered an ecosystem, since it is home to numerous microorganisms. On a much larger scale, the history of various human societies provides an instructive illustration as to the ways that ecosystems have influenced civilizations.

<p><b>Complex Ecosystem: -</b> 
<p>A complex ecosystem contains a wide variety of organisms at each level of a food chain.

<h3><p>SYSTEM INDICATORS OF AN ECOSYSTEM</h3> 
<p><b>State Variable: -</b> 
<p>A state variable is one of the set of variables that are used to describe the mathematical "state" of a dynamical system. Intuitively, the state of a system describes enough about the system to determine its future behavior. Models that consist of coupled first-order differential equations are said to be in state-variable form.

<p><b>Critical Variable: -</b> 
<p>Critical variable is the variable explaining the conditions of, such as specific values of temperature, pressure or composition. These are the conditions which explain a sudden change in an ecosystem or its constituent organisms or their behavior.

<p><b>Indicators of inter-relationships: -</b> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Population of an organism
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Health

<p><b>Succession: -</b> 
<p>Ecological succession is the observed process of change in the species structure of an ecological community over time. The community begins with relatively few pioneering plants and animals and develops through increasing complexity until it becomes stable or self-perpetuating as a climax community.
<p>In easy words,
<br>Ecological succession is the gradual process by which ecosystems change and develop over time. Nothing remains the same and habitats are constantly changing.

<p><b>Types of ecological succession: -</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1. Primary Succession: -</b> 
<p>Successional dynamics beginning with colonization of an area that has not been previously occupied by an ecological community, such as newly exposed rock or sand surfaces, lava flows, newly exposed glacial tills, etc., are referred to as primary succession.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_succession)

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2. Secondary Succession: -</b> 
<p>Successional dynamics following severe disturbance or removal of a pre-existing community are called secondary succession. Dynamics in secondary succession are strongly influenced by pre-disturbance conditions, including soil development, seed banks, remaining organic matter, and residual living organisms.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_succession)

<p>Causes of plant succession: - 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Autogenic succession can be brought by changes in the soil caused by the organisms there. These changes include accumulation of organic matter in litter or humic layer, alteration of soil nutrients, change in pH of soil by plants growing there.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Allogenic succession is caused by external environmental influences and not by the vegetation. For example soil changes due to erosion, leaching or the deposition of silt and clays can alter the nutrient content and water relationships in the ecosystems. Animals also play an important role in allogenic changes as they are pollinators, seed dispersers and herbivores.
<p style="text-align: right">(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_succession)

Patterns / Stages of Ecological Succession: - The patterns of succession are relatively predictable in most areas. Grasses always move in first, followed by a series of vegetation which eventually leads to the "climax forest". Any particular region has its own set of climax [climax- the end stage of a succession] species, which are the plants that are best adapted for the area and will persist after succession has finished, until another disturbance clears the area.

<p>This is an example of Secondary Succession by stages:
 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. A stable deciduous forest community
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.  A disturbance, such as a wild fire, destroys the forest
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.  The fire burns the forest to the ground 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The fire leaves behind empty, but not destroyed, soil 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Grasses and other herbaceous plants grow back first
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Small bushes and trees begin to colonize the area
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Fast growing evergreen trees develop to their fullest, while shade-tolerant trees develop in the understory
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. The short-lived and shade intolerant evergreen trees die as the larger deciduous trees overtop them. The ecosystem is now back to a similar state to where it began.

<p><b>Systems resilience: -</b>
<p>Resilience is the capacity of an ecosystem to respond to a perturbation [change in a system] or disturbance by resisting damage and recovering quickly. Such perturbations and disturbances can include stochastic events such as fires, flooding, windstorms, insect population explosions, and human activities such as deforestation and the introduction of exotic plant or animal species. Disturbances of sufficient magnitude or duration can profoundly affect an ecosystem and may force an ecosystem to reach a threshold beyond which a different regime of processes and structures predominates. Human activities that adversely affect ecosystem resilience such as reduction of biodiversity, exploitation of natural resources, pollution, land-use, and anthropogenic climate change are increasingly causing regime shifts in ecosystems, often to less desirable and degraded conditions.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilience_(ecology))

<p><b>Indicator Species: -</b> 
<p>An indicator species is any biological species that defines a trait or characteristic of the environment. For example, a species may delineate an ecoregion or indicate an environmental condition such as a disease outbreak, pollution, species competition or climate change. Indicator species can be among the most sensitive species in a region, and sometimes act as an early warning to monitoring biologists.

<p>For example,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Trout are an indicator species.  You can tell how healthy the stream is by counting the number of trout and the size of trout in a particular section.  Trout need clean water, a certain temperature range of water, protection from predators, unsilted gravel to spawn in, and a food supply like smaller fish and invertebrates.  So absence of trout means absence of these factors, which by extension means an unhealthy stream.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Butterflies have been identified as the 'biotic-indicators' for the species richness monitoring system in an ecosystem and similarly for forecasting the climatic change impacts on biodiversity. It has already been found from the scientific experiments that, by using butterflies as indicators, increase of species richness and species assemblage have been augmented to 47% in a wild state. This wild state has been used as the healthy habitat for all kinds of animals
<p>Use of butterflies as "indicators" is possible because they need three types of vegetation populations for their survival and distribution. This distribution is highly related with the phenological stages of the plants, the three types of plant population categories are larval food plants, nectar plants, and shade plants.
<p>The butterflies use food-plants as egg laying supports. Butterfly species are very selective in plants for their egg laying activities. A female butterfly lays her egg only on a single plant on which its larva can develop by feeding on it; mainly by feeding on the leaves.

<p>The condition of the environment can be predicted by observing these indicators and methods can be used accordingly.
