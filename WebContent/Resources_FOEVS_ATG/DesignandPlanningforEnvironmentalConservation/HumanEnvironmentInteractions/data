<h2 style="text-align: center">HUMAN ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS</h2>

<p><b>Quality of life vs. Quality of environment: -</b> 
<p>As quality of life of now-a-days is enhancing, the quality of environment is degrading. We can see this through real-life examples. We use vehicles on a very large scale to make transportation easy. But they are one of the major causes of pollution.
<p>This proves that if we try to make life easy using advanced technology, we tend to degrade environment more and more.
<p>But quality of life and quality of environment can be independent of each other if we use nature friendly sources to fulfill our needs.

<p><b>Environmental Issues: -</b> 
<p>Environmental issues are harmful aspects of human activity on the biophysical environment. Environmentalism, a social and environmental movement that started in the 1960s, addresses environmental issues through advocacy, education and activism. current problems faced by the environment-
<p>The carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere has already exceeded 390 parts per million (NOAA) (with total "long-term" GHG exceeding 455 parts per million). (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report) This level is considered a tipping point. "The amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is already above the threshold that can potentially cause dangerous climate change. We are already at risk...It's not next year or next decade, it's now."

<p><b>Report from the UN office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA): -</b>
<p>"Climate disasters are on the rise. Around 70 percent of disasters are now climate related - up from around 50 percent from two decades ago. These disasters take a heavier human toll and come with a higher price tag. In the last decade, 2.4 billion people were affected by climate related disasters, compared to1.7 billion in the previous decade. The cost of responding to disasters has risen tenfold between 1992 and 2008. Destructive sudden heavy rains, intense tropical storms, repeated flooding and droughts are likely to increase, as will the vulnerability of local communities in the absence of strong concerted action." (OCHA) "Climate change is not just a distant future threat. It is the main driver behind rising humanitarian needs and we are seeing its impact. The number of people affected and the damages inflicted by extreme weather has been unprecedented."

<p><b>Effects of beliefs and values: -</b> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Environmental behavior depends on personal and situational variables in an interactive way.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 When high conflict level is generated between personal dispositions and situational conditions, the predictive power of attitudes tends to be minimal, whereas in the case of consistency between them it tends to be maximal. The influence of situational variables was found to depend on the environmental action considered. In some cases, situational variables were the most important, whereas in others, commitment or moral obligation played an essential role.
