<h2 style="text-align: center">EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT OF IMPACTS</h2>

<p>Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a process of evaluating the likely environmental impacts of a proposed project or development, taking into account inter-related socio-economic, cultural and human-health impacts, both beneficial and adverse.

<p><b>Main Objectives of EIA: -</b> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 ensuring environmental factors are considered in the decision-making process
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 ensuring that possible adverse environmental impacts are identified and avoided or minimized
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 informing the public about the proposal

<p><b>Advantages / Necessity of EIA: -</b> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 facilitates the design of a monitoring programme
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 allows people to examine the underlying need for a project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 gives people the opportunity to identify problems
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 helps a developer to design a more publicly acceptable project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 exploration of alternatives can help identify cost-saving and other beneficial changes

<p>According to a United Nations Environment Program Training Resource Manual the main advantages and benefits of EIA are:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 improved project design/siting;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 more informed decision-making;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 more environmentally sensitive decisions;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 increased accountability and transparency during the development process;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 improved integration of projects into their environmental and social setting;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 reduced environmental damage;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 more effective projects in terms of meeting their financial and/or socio-economic objectives; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 a positive contribution toward achieving sustainability.

<p><b>Approaches and Techniques: -</b> 
<p>The fundamental components of an EIA would necessarily involve the following stages:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <b>Screening,</b> to determine which projects or developments require a full or partial impact assessment study;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <b>Scoping,</b> to identify which potential impacts are relevant to assess (based on legislative requirements, international conventions, expert knowledge and public involvement), to identify alternative solutions that avoid, mitigate or compensate adverse impacts on biodiversity (including the option of not proceeding with the development, finding alternative designs or sites which avoid the impacts, incorporating safeguards in the design of the project, or providing compensation for adverse impacts), and finally to derive terms of reference for the impact assessment;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. <b>Assessment and evaluation of impacts and development of alternatives,</b> to predict and identify the likely environmental impacts of a proposed project or development, including the detailed elaboration of alternatives;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. <b>Reporting the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or EIA report,</b> including an environmental management plan (EMP), and a non-technical summary for the general audience.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. <b>Review of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS),</b> based on the terms of reference (scoping) and public (including authority) participation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. <b>Decision-making,</b> on whether to approve the project or not, and under what conditions; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g. <b>Monitoring,</b> compliance, enforcement and environmental auditing. Monitor whether the predicted impacts and proposed mitigation measures occur as defined in the EMP. Verify the compliance of proponent with the EMP, to ensure that unpredicted impacts or failed mitigation measures are identified and addressed in a timely fashion.\
