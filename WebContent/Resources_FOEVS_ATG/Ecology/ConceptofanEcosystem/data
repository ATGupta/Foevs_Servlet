<h2 style="text-align: center">CONCEPT OF AN ECOSYSTEM</h2>
<p>Ecosystem is an ecological community together with its environment, functioning as a unit. It is a community of living organisms (plants, animals and microbes) in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a system.

<p><b>Ecology: -</b> Ecology is the scientific study of the relationships that living organisms have with each other and with their natural environment.

<p><b>Relation between the living organisms: -</b>
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_relationship)
<p>When two or more same or different types of organisms live in same niche, they have some type of relationships. These relationships can have both negative and positive results. We'll discuss those relationships below. They are: -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Competition
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Predation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Pollination
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Dispersal
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Food Chain

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <h3><p>1. Competition</h3>
<p> Competition is when organisms compete for the same resources. This is a negative relationship because both organisms are harming each other (Campbell).
<br>There are two types of competitions between the organisms: -
<br>Intraspecies competition and interspecies competition.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226<b> Intraspecies competition</b>
<p>Organisms competing can be from within the same species for example, two male elk fighting for a female mate. Elephants also fight each other so that the dominant elephant will get to breed with the female. 

\image image1
<p style="text-align: center">Fig. 1. Elephants fighting for dominance / a female mate
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <b>Interspecies competition</b>
<p>Competition can be also found in two different species. A lizard and a frog can compete for a similar food they eat such as a small insect. This type of competition is only found when two different species share an ecological niche that they must compete over.

<p><b>Competitive exclusion principle</b>
<p>Direct competition between different species almost always produces a winner and a loser- and the losing species dies out, or is forced to migrate to another ecosystem which can support them (Levine, 2010). This is the competitive exclusion principle. This principle says that two species that need the same resources cannot survive together in the same habitat. One organism will eventually die off, thus, called.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <h3><p>2. Predation: -</h3>
<p> Predation is the capturing of prey as a means of maintaining life. This is where one organism hunts and eats the other organism. The organism hunting is called predator, while the organism being hunted is called prey. Energy received from the sun is transferred from animals when the prey is eaten by the predator. The predator now has its prey's energy.
<br>A prey can be a plant or an animal. This implies that a predator can be a herbivore or a carnivore.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <h3><p>3. Pollination: -</h3>
<p> Pollination is a process of transfer of pollen grains from anther to stigma. It is done by insects, bees, animals/humans or through wind. Pollination can be directly / indirectly called the base of any ecosystem as it is the only source for herbs, it gives birth to a new fruit (seed).
<br>And think, we are killing the insects, the main pollinators, by using insecticides!

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <h3><p>4. Dispersal: -</h3>
<p> Seed dispersal is the movement or transport of seeds away from the parent plant. Plants have limited mobility and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules [any of various usually vegetative portions of a plant, such as a bud or other offshoot, that aid in dispersal of the species and from which a new individual may develop], including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <h3><p>5. Food chain: -</h3>
<p> A hierarchical [of or relating to body of persons having authority] series of organisms each dependent on the next as a source of food.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <h3><p>6. Food web: -</h3>
<p> Food Web is system of interlocking and interdependent food chains. It is a network of food chains or feeding relationships by which energy and nutrients are passed on from one species of living organisms to another.

<p><b>Trophic relationships: -</b><br> [Trophic - of or relating to nutrition] Trophic relationship can be represented as food web or food chain.

<p><b>Biomagnification, bioaccumulation and bioconcentration of toxic wastes: -</b>

<p>Biomagnification, also known as bioamplification or biological magnification, is the increase in concentration of a substance that occurs in a food chain as a consequence of:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Persistence (can't be broken down by environmental processes)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Food chain energetics
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Low (or nonexistent) rate of internal degradation/excretion of the substance (often due to water-insolubility)
<p>The following is an example showing how biomagnification takes place in nature: An anchovy eats zooplanktons that have tiny amounts of mercury that the zooplankton has picked up from the water throughout the anchovie's lifespan. A tuna eats many of these anchovies over its life, accumulating the mercury in each of those anchovies into its body. If the mercury stunts the growth of the anchovies, that tuna is required to eat more little fish to stay alive. Because there are more little fish being eaten, the mercury content is magnified.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomagnification)

<p><b>Bioaccumulation: -</b><br> Bioaccumulation refers to the accumulation of substances, such as pesticides, or other organic chemicals in an organism. Bioaccumulation occurs when an organism absorbs a toxic substance at a rate greater than that at which the substance is lost.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation)

<p><b>Bioconcentration: -</b><br> Bioconcentration is a related but more specific term, referring to uptake and accumulation of a substance from water alone. By contrast, bioaccumulation refers to uptake from all sources combined (e.g. water, food, air, etc.)

<p><b>Types of relationships: -</b> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1. Competition: -</b><br> Discussed above.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2. Mutualism: -</b><br> Mutualism is a relationship in which organisms benefit from each other. This is a positive, positive relationship.
<br>An example of this would be the bee and the flower. The bee gets nectar and honey from the flower. The bee contributes back to the flower by spreading the pollen so that the flowers can reproduce.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_relationship) 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>3. Parasitism: -</b><br> Parasitism is a relationship in which one organism (the parasite) benefits while the other (the host) is harmed. This is a positive, negative relationship. The parasite usually lives on or inside the other organism. For example, mosquito is a parasite, feeding on a human while transferring the disease called Malaria. Another example would be the sun fish and the organisms that live in their skin (The Blue Planet), or a tick or fleas that lives off of a dog. Similarly, lice are an example of parasitism because they feed on blood from the humans head.

<p><b>Coevolution and introduction of species: -</b>
<p>The term coevolution is used to describe cases where two (or more) species reciprocally affect each other's evolution.
<p>In biology, coevolution is "the change of a biological object triggered by the change of a related object."
<p>For example, an evolutionary change in the morphology of a plant, might affect the morphology of an herbivore that eats the plant, which in turn might affect the evolution of the plant, which might affect the evolution of the herbivore...and so on.
<p>Coevolution is likely to happen when different species have close ecological interactions with one another. These ecological relationships include:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Predator/prey and parasite/host
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Competitive species
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Mutualistic species
