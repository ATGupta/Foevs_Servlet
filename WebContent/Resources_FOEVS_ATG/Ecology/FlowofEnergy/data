<h2 style="text-align: center">FLOW OF ENERGY</h2>

<p>All types of energy flow in an ecosystem take place through a simple process - Food chain.
<p>Energy comes ultimately from sun and is transferred to all other organisms directly or indirectly. This energy is first of all used by plants through photosynthesis and is transferred to the whole ecosystem. From plants to consumers - herbivores > carnivores / omnivores > decomposers. Decomposes convert all the dead and organic matter to the substances which can be absorbed by the plants to continue this cycle.

<p><b>Efficiency: -</b> 
<p>The fraction of energy converted into useful energy from one level to a higher level of organisms in a food chain of an ecosystem.
<p>As we are studying environmental science, we will read here 4 types of efficiencies: -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Photosynthetic efficiency
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Tropic efficiency
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Assimilation efficiency
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Production efficiency

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1. Photosynthetic efficiency: -</b>
<p>The photosynthetic efficiency is the fraction of light energy converted into chemical energy during photosynthesis in plants and algae. Photosynthesis can be described by the simplified chemical reaction
<br>H2O + CO2 + energy &#8594 CH2O + O2,
<br>where CH2O represents carbohydrates such as sugars, cellulose, and lignin. The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined. On a molecular level, the theoretical limit in efficiency is 25%.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2. Tropic efficiency: -</b>
<p>Trophic Efficiency is the Ratio of consumer-species ecological productivity to productivity supplied by the consumer's food.
<p>In other words, how much of what a consumer eats ends up being stored as a part of the consumer. Trophic efficiencies on a per-consumer species basis - or, indeed, per consumer-consumed pairing - generally range from about 5% to 20%.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>3. Assimilation efficiency: -</b>
<br>[assimilation - a act/process of consuming nutrients after digestion]
<p>Assimilation efficiency is the fraction of ingested food that is absorbed and used in metabolism.
<p>Herbivores assimilate between 15 and 80 percent of the plant material they ingest, depending on their physiology and the part of the plant that they eat. For example, herbivores that eat seeds and young vegetation high in energy have the highest assimilation.

<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/39344/assimilation-efficiency)

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>4. Production efficiency: -</b>
<p>Production efficiency is the amount of consumer production divided by the amount of assimilation.

<p><b>Tropic Levels: -</b>
<p>Trophic levels are the feeding position in a food chain such as primary producers, herbivore, primary carnivore, etc. Green plants form the first trophic level, the producers. Herbivores form the second trophic level, while carnivores form the third and even the fourth trophic levels. In this section we will discuss what is meant by food chains, food webs and ecological pyramids.

<p><b>Ecological pyramid: -</b>
<p>An ecological pyramid (also trophic pyramid or energy pyramid) is a graphical representation designed to show the biomass or biomass at each trophic level in a given ecosystem.

<p style="text-align: center">Fig. 4. Ecological Pyramid
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_pyramid)

<p>There are two types of ecological pyramids: -
<br>Pyramid of biomass and pyramid of numbers.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1. Pyramid of biomass: -</b>
<p>An ecological pyramid of biomass shows the relationship between biomass and trophic level by quantifying the amount of biomass present at each trophic level of an ecological community at a particular moment in time. It is a graphical representation of biomass present in unit area in different tropic levels.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2. Pyramid of numbers: -</b>
<p>An ecological pyramid of numbers shows graphically the population of each level in a food chain.

<p style="text-align: center"><img style="height: 300px" src="Resources_FOEVS_ATG/Ecology/FlowofEnergy/image5">
<p style="text-align: center">Fig. 5. Pyramid of numbers
<p>The diagram above shows a (nonfictional) example of a five level pyramid of numbers: 10,000 fresh water shrimps support 1,000 bleak, which in turn support 100 perches followed by 10 northern pikes and finally one osprey.

<p><b>Energy flow -</b>
<p>Ecological pyramids begin with producers on the bottom (such as plants) and proceed through the various trophic levels (such as herbivores that eat plants, then carnivores that eat herbivores, then carnivores that eat those carnivores, and so on). The highest level is the top of the food chain.
