<h2 style="text-align: center">BIOMES</h2>

<p><b>Biomes</b> are climatically and geographically defined as similar climatic conditions on the Earth, such as communities of plants, animals, and soil organisms, and are often referred to as ecosystems.
<p>Fundamental classification of biomes: -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Terrestrial (land) biomes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Aquatic biomes (including freshwater biomes and marine biomes)
<p>Examples of Biomes: - Tropical rain forests, deserts, grasslands, coral reefs, lakes.

<h3><p>TERRESTRIAL BOMES</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">(https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/#)

<p><b>TUNDRA BIOME</b>

<p><b>Vegetation:</b> 
<p>lichens, mosses, sedges, perennial forbs, and dwarfed shrubs, (often heaths, but also birches and willows).

<p><b>Growthforms:</b> 
<p>typical are ground-hugging and other warmth-preserving forms including:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 tussock-forming graminoids [tussock - A clump or tuft, as of growing grass; graminoids - Of or resembling the grasses]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 mats or cushion plants, often evergreen members of the heath family
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 rosettes [a circular cluster of leaves growing from the base of a stem]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 dwarf shrubs, some of which are deciduous in habit

<p><b>Climate: </b>
<p>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Extremely short growing season (6 to 10 weeks)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Long, cold, dark winters (6 to 10 months with mean monthly temperatures below 32° F or 0° C.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Low precipitation (less than five inches/year) coupled with strong, drying winds. Snowfall is actually advantageous to plant and animal life as it provides an insulating layer on the ground surface.

<p><b>Soil:</b> 
<p>No true soil is developed in this biome due to the edaphic factors mentioned above.

<p><b>Fauna:</b> 
<p>Strategies evolved to withstand the harsh conditions of the tundra can be divided among those species that are resident and those that are migratory.
<p>Among the small number of bird (e.g., ptarmigan) and mammal (e.g., muskox, arctic hare, arctic fox, musk ox) species that reside year-round on the tundra one commonly finds.
<p style="text-align: right">(https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/?page_id=89)

<p><b>TAIGA / BOREAL FOREST BIOME</b>

<p><b>Climate:</b> 
<p>The taiga corresponds with regions of subarctic and cold continental climate. Long, severe winters (up to six months with mean temperatures below freezing) and short summers (50 to 100 frost-free days) are characteristic, as is a wide range of temperatures between the lows of winter and highs of summer. For example, Verkhoyansk, Russia, has recorded extremes of minus 90 ° F and plus 90 ° F. Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches, but low evaporation rates make this a humid climate.

<p><b>Vegetation:</b> 
<p>Needleleaf, coniferous (gymnosperm) trees are the dominant plants of the taiga biome. A very few species in four main genera are found: the evergreen spruce (Picea), fir (Abies), and pine (Pinus), and the deciduous larch or tamarack (Larix). In North America, one or two species of fir and one or two species of spruce are dominant. Across Scandanavia and western Russia the Scots pine is a common component of the taiga.
<p>Broadleaf deciduous trees and shrubs are members of early successional stages of both primary and secondary succession. Most common are alder (Alnus), birch (Betula), and aspen (Populus).

<p><b>Growthforms:</b> 
<p>The conical or spire-shaped needleleaf trees common to the taiga are adapted to the cold and the physiological drought of winter and to the short-growing season:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226  <b>Conical shape</b> - promotes shedding of snow and prevents loss of branches.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226  <b>Needleleaf</b> - narrowness reduces surface area through which water may be lost (transpired), especially during winter when the frozen ground prevents plants from replenishing their water supply. The needles of boreal conifers also have thick waxy coatings-a waterproof cuticle-in which stomata are sunken and protected from drying winds.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226  <b>Evergreen habit</b> - retention of foliage allows plants to photosynthesize as soon as temperatures permit in spring, rather than having to waste time in the short growing season merely growing leaves. [Note: Deciduous larch are dominant in areas underlain by nearly continuous permafrost and having a climate even too dry and cold for the waxy needles of spruce and fir.]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226  <b>Dark color</b> - the dark green of spruce and fir needles helps the foliage absorb maximum heat from the sun and begin photosynthesis as early as possible.

<p><b>Soil:</b> 
<p>Podzolization occurs as a result of the acid soil solution produced under needleleaf trees. The main soil order associated with the taiga is spodosol.

<p><b>Fauna:</b> 
<p>Fur-bearing predators like the lynx (Felis lynx) and various members of the weasel family (e.g., wolverine, fisher, pine martin, mink, ermine, and sable) are perhaps most characteristic of the boreal forest proper. The mammalian herbivores on which they feed include the snowshoe or varying hare, red squirrel, lemmings, and voles.
<p>Large herbivores are more closely associated with successional stages where there is more nutritious browse available and include elk or wapiti (Cervus elaphus, known as red deer in Europe) and moose (Alces alces, known as elk in Europe). The beaver (Castor canadensis), on which the early North American fur trade was based, is also a creature of early successional communities, indeed its dams along streams create such habitats.
<p>Among birds, insect-eaters like the wood warblers are migratory and leave after the breeding season. Seed-eaters (e.g., finches and sparrows) and omnivores (e.g., ravens) tend to be year-round residents. During poor cone years, normal residents like the evening grosbeak, pine siskin, and red crossbill leave the taiga in winter and may be seen at bird feeders here in Virginia.
<p style="text-align: right">(https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/?page_id=92)

<p><b>TEMPERATE BROADLEAF DECIDUOUS FOREST BIOME</b>

<p><b>Climate:</b> 
<p>Associated with warmer continental and humid subtropical climates. There is an approximately 6 month growing season. The 20 to 60 inches of precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year. The non-growing season is due to temperature-induced drought during the cold winters.

<p><b>Vegetation:</b> 
<p>Many of the same genera, previously part of an Arcto-Tertiary Geoflora, are common to all three of the disjunct northern hemisphere expressions of this biome. Included among a circular cluster of leaves growing from the base of a stem these genera are Quercus (oak), Acer (maple), Fagus (beech), Castanea (chestnut), Carya (hickory), Ulmus (elm), a circular cluster of leaves growing from the base of a stem a circular cluster of leaves growing from the base of a stem Tilia(basswood or linden), Juglans (walnut), and Liquidamber (sweet gum). Different species of these genera occur on each continent.

<p><b>Structure and Growthforms:</b> 
<p>Five layers are recognized:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 a tree stratum, 60 -100 feet high, dominated regionally by various combinations of the genera listed above;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 a small tree or sapling layer, with not only younger specimens of the tall trees with species limited to this layer such as (in Virginia) Allegheny serviceberry or shadbush, sourwood, dogwood, and redbud;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 a shrub layer often with members of the heath family such as rhododendron, azaleas, mountain laurel, and huckleberries;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 an herb layer of perennial forbs that bloom primarily in early spring; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 a ground layer of lichens, clubmosses, and true mosses. Lichens and mosses also grow on the trunks of trees.
<p>Lianas such as wild grape, poison ivy, and Virginia creeper climb the trees to flower and fruit high in the forest canopy.

<p><b>Soils:</b> 
<p>Brown forest soils (alfisols, in the American soil taxonomy) develop under the TBDF. Broadleaf trees tend to be nutrient-demanding and their leaves bind the major nutrient bases. Thus the litter under this forest is not as acidic as under needleleaf trees and aluminum and iron are not mobilized from the A horizon. The autumn leaf fall provides for an abundant and rich humus which begins to decay rapidly in spring just as the growing season begins. The humus content gives both A and B horizons a brown color. [Until John Deere's invention of the steel plow in the 1800s and the subsequent ability to break the prairie sod, the alfisols were considered the most fertile, most easily worked, and most easily cleared of northern hemisphere temperate zone soils. Many have been under continuous cultivation since the Neolithic.
 
<p><b>Fauna:</b> 
<p>Characteristic members of the fauna are either mast-eaters (nut and acorn feeders) or omnivores. Mammals show adaptations to an arboreal life; a few hibernate during the winter months.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 North American herbivores include white-tail deer, gray squirrel, and chipmunk.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Omnivores include raccoon, opossum, skunk, and black bear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Carnivores have been largely eliminated through the deliberate effort of humans but should include timber wolves, mountain lions, and bobcats. The coyote, native to the western grasslands and deserts, has recently dispersed east and taken over the niche of its departed cousin, the timber wolf.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Resident bird species also tend to be seed-eaters or omnivores. Many, like the several species of woodpeckers and the chickadees, are cavity-nesters. The loud, conspicuous blue jay is a major agent in the dispersal of oaks onto abandoned farmland and pastures. Migratory species tend to be insectivorous and include many so-called neotropical migrants, including warblers, wrens, thrushes, tanagers, and hummingbirds.

<p><b>MEDETERRANIAN SCRUB BIOME</b>

<p><b>Climate:</b> 
<p>The Mediterranean Climate is unique in that the wet season coincides with the low sun or winter period. Summers are dry. Total annual precipitation ranges between 15 and 40 inches per year. Temperatures are those of the subtropics moderated by maritime influence and fogs associated with the cold ocean currents. The result is a very limited, but predictable, growing season when there is both sufficient soil moisture and adequately warm temperatures.

<p><b>Vegetation:</b> <p>Throughout the world, the Mediterranean biome is characterized by shrubs. In most regions these shrubs are evergreen and have small, leathery (sclerophyllous) leaves with thick cuticles. Sometimes the leaves are so reduced as to appear needle-like. Many typical members of the shrub flora are aromatic (for example, sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano) and contain highly flammable oils.
<p>Mediterranean regions have long been impacted by humans especially through the use of fire and the grazing of livestock. The Mediterranean proper, we know from classical Greek literature, was formerly forested with live oaks, pines, cedars, wild carob and wild olive. The shrublands of California, likewise, are believed much more extensive today than before aboriginal burning and Spanish livestock grazing.
<p style="text-align: right">(https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/?page_id=98)

<p><b>TEMPERATE GRASSLANDS</b>

<p><b>Climate:</b> 
<p>Semiarid, continental climates of the middle latitudes typically have between 10 and 20 inches of precipitation a year. Much of this falls as snow, serving as reservoir of moisture for the beginning of the growing season. Warm to hot summers are experienced, depending on latitude.

<p><b>Vegetation:</b> 
<p>Perennial grasses and perennial forbs [especially Compositae (or Asteraceae, depending on the taxonomic system used) and Leguminosae--the sunflower and pea families, respectively] are dominant growthforms. Two or more strata of grasses (erect grasses and recumbent species) are recognized in the more humid expressions of the biome.

<p><b>Grasses.</b> 
<p>Perennial grasses, with their growth buds at or just below the surface, are well-adapted to drought, fire, and cold. The tiller or narrow, upright stem reduces heat-gain in the hot summers; the intricate root systems trap moisture and nutrients. Two basic types are:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Turf- or sod-forming grasses, with rhizomes or underground stems from which new plants spring forth; associated with the more humid grasslands
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Bunch grasses, without rhizomes, that reproduce by seed; associated with the drier parts of the biome.
<p style="text-align: right">(https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/?page_id=173)

<p><b>DESERTSCRUB BIOME</b>

<p><b>Climate:</b> 
<p>Arid climates are those which average less than 10 inches of precipitation a year. Potential evaporation exceeds precipitation in the annual water budget. Furthermore, rainfall is highly localized and relatively unpredictable in terms of when it will occur, although usually there are seasons of highest probability for precipitation. Annual variation in total precipitation may also be great. Temperatures are also variable. They may exceed 100° F on summer afternoons, but dip by 20-30 degrees or more at night. Winters are cool to cold: "hot deserts" rarely experience frost; "cold deserts" may have prolonged periods of below freezing temperatures and snowfall.

<p><b>Vegetation:</b> 
<p>Shrubs are the dominant growthform of deserts. They may be evergreen or deciduous; typically have small leaves; and frequently have spines or thorns and/or aromatic oils. Shallow but extensive root systems procure rainwater from well beyond the canopy of the shrub whenever it does rain. These are the true xerophytes adapted to tolerate extreme drought. They form an open canopy and, except after rains when annuals may cover the desert floor, the ground between shrubs is bare of vegetative growth.
<p>Water is not entirely lacking in the desert environment and several other growthforms represent strategies to reach water or to store water:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Phreatophytes are plants with long taproots that may extend downward 20 to 30 feet to tap ground water supplies. Especially along intermittent streams or under dunes, underground water may be readily available. Mesquite is a good example here in North America.
<br>One of the world's most unusual phreatophyes is Welwitschia mirabilis of the Namib.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Succulents store water accumulated during rains for use during the intervening dry spells. Different species store water in different parts of the plant; hence we can recognize stem succulents, leaf succulents, root succulents, and fruit succulents. Many plant families have members that evolved succulence. Most prominent among stem succulents in the Americas are the Cactaceae; in Africa succulent euphorbias have evolved shapes and sizes resembling the cacti. The agaves (Liliaceae) are examples of leaf succulents in the Americas; their role is filled by aloes (Liliaceae) in Africa. Most succulents do not tolerate freezing temperatures so they are essentially limited to the hot deserts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Another growthform adapted to desert conditions is the ephemeral. This is an especially short-lived annual forb that completes its life cycle in two-three weeks. The seeds are encased in a waterproof coating that prevents desiccation for years if necessary. These plants essentially avoid drought by occurring as seeds most of the time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Perennial forbs with underground bulbs store nutrients and water in undergound tissues and also remain dormant most of the year. They can sprout rapidly after sufficient rains and replenish their undergound stores.

<p><b>Soils:</b> 
<p>Calcification is the dominant soil-forming process, if indeed soil forming even occurs. There is poor development of horizons, with accumulation of calcium carbonate at or near the surface. Sparse vegetative cover and tiny leaves results in little humus and soils typically have a light gray color. Aridosolsare the dominant soil order.

<p><b>Fauna:</b> 
<p>Like the plants, the animals of the desert have evolved an array of strategies for dealing with aridity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Behavioral adaptations such as being nocturnal or crepuscular, being fossorial, and staying the shade during the heat of day are common.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Morphological adaptations include those noticed by Bergmann, Allen, and Golger. The better to radiate body heat to the environment from warm-blooded animals, body sizes are small and appendages long. Pelage and plumage is light colored to reflect sunlight and help prevent the absorption of heat form the environment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Rarer, but important, are physiological adaptations such as aestivation (dormancy during summer), the absence of sweat glands, the concentration of urine, localized deposits of fat in tails or humps; and salt glands to secrete salt without loosing fluids.
<p>Reptiles with their waterproof skin, production of uric acid instead of urine, hard-shelled eggs, and ability to gain body heat directly from the sun and to retreat to shade or underground to avoid heat are exceptionally well adapted to drylands and, not surprisingly, diverse there.
<p>Many birds in the North American deserts, so fragmented by mountains offering humid habitats and permanent streams, simply fly to free water and so are not limited by the lack of open water. They maintain breeding seasons like other temperate zone birds synchronized by changing photoperiods. In Australia, where the desert geography is quite different and aridity more pervasive, bird populations synchronize their breeding readiness according to cues of rainfall, however erratic and sporadic that may be.

<p><b>TROPICAL REINFOREST BIOME</b>

<p><b>Climate:</b> 
<p>Mean monthly temperatures are above 64 ° F; precipitation is often in excess of 100 inches a year. There is usually a brief season of reduced precipitation. In monsoonal areas, there is a real dry season, but that is more than compensated for with abundant precipitation the rest of the year.

<p><b>Vegetation:</b> 
<p>A vertical stratification of three layer of trees is apparent.. These layers have been identified as A, B, and C layers:
<p><u>A layer</u>: 
<p>the emergents. Widely spaced trees 100 to 120 feet tall and with umbrella-shaped canopies extend above the general canopy of the forest. Since they must contend with drying winds, they tend to have small leaves and some species are deci duous during the brief dry season.
<p><u>B layer</u>: 
<p>a closed canopy of 80 foot trees. Light is readily available at the top of this layer, but greatly reduced below it.
<p><u>C layer</u>: 
<p>a closed canopy of 60 foot trees. There is little air movement in this zone and consequently humidity is constantly high.
<p><u>Shrub/sapling layer:</u> 
<p>Less than 3 percent of the light intercepted at the top of the forest canopy passes to this layer. Arrested growth is characteristic of young trees capable of a rapid surge of growth when a gap in canopy above them opens.
<p><u>Ground layer</u>: 
<p>sparse plant growth. Less than 1 percent of the light that strikes the top of the forest penetrates to the forest floor. In such darkness few green plants grow. Moisture is also reduced by the canopy above: one third of the precipitation is intercepted before it reaches the ground.

<p><b>Growthforms:</b> 
<p>Various growthforms represent strategies to reach sunlight:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>Epiphytes</u>: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the so-called air plants grow on branches high in the trees, using the limbs merely for support and extracting moisture from the air and trapping the constant leaf-fall and wind-blown dust. Bromeliads (pineapple family) are especially abundant in the neotropics; the orchid family is widely distributed in all three formations of the tropical rainforest. As demonstration of the relative aridity of exposed branches in the high canopy, epiphytic cacti also occur in the Americas.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>Lianas</u>: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; woody vines grow rapidly up the tree trunks when there is a temporary gap in the canopy and flower and fruit in the tree tops of the A and B layers. Many are deciduous.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>Climbers</u>: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; green-stemmed plants such as philodendron that remain in the understory. Many climbers, including the ancestors of the domesticated yams (Africa) and sweet potatoes (South America), store nutrients in roots and tubers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>Stranglers</u>: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these plants begin life as epiphytes in the canopy and send their roots downward to the forest floor. The fig family is well represented among stranglers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 <u>Heterotrophs</u>: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; non-photosynthetic plants can live on the forest floor.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Parasites derive their nutrients by tapping into the roots or stems of photosynthetic species. Rafflesia arnoldi, a root parasite of a liana, has the world's largest flower, more than three feet in diameter. It produces an odor similar to rotting flesh to attract pollinating insects.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Saprophytes derive their nutrients from decaying organic matter. Some orchids employ this strategy common to fungi and bacteria.

<p><b>Soils:</b> 
<p>Oxisols, infertile, deeply weathered and severely leached, have developed on the ancient Gondwanan shields. Rapid bacterial decay prevents the accumulation of humus. The concentration of iron and aluminum oxides by the laterization pro cess gives the oxisols a bright red color and sometimes produces minable deposits (e.g., bauxite). On younger substrates, especially of volcanic origin, tropical soils may be quite fertile.
<p><b>Fauna:</b> 
<p>Animal life is highly diverse. Common characteristics found among mammals and birds (and reptiles and amphibians, too) include adaptations to an arboreal life (for example, the prehensile tails of New World monkeys), bright colors and sharp patterns, loud vocalizations, and diets heavy on fruits.
<p style="text-align: right">(https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/?page_id=100)

<p><b>TROPICAL SAVANNA BIOME</b>

<p><b>Vegetation:</b> 
<p>Savannas are characterized by a continuous cover of perennial grasses, often 3 to 6 feet tall at maturity. They may or may not also have an open canopy of drought-resistant, fire-resistant, or browse-resistant trees, or they may have an open shrub layer. Distinction is made between tree or woodland savanna, park savanna, shrub savanna and grass savanna. Furthermore, savannas may be distinguished according to the dominant taxon in the tree layer: for example, palm savannas, pine savannas, and acacia savannas.

<p><b>Climate:</b> 
<p>A tropical wet and dry climate predominates in areas covered by savanna growth. Mean monthly temperatures are at or above 64° F and annual precipitation averages between 30 and 50 inches. For at least five months of the year, during the dry season, less than 4 inches a month are received. The dry season is associated with the low sun period.

<p><b>Soils:</b> 
<p>Soils vary according to bedrock and edaphic conditions. In general, however, laterization is the dominant soil-forming process and low fertility oxisols can be expected.

<p><b>Fauna:</b> 
<p>The world's greatest diversity (over 40 different species) of ungulates (hoofed mammals) is found on the savannas of Africa. The antelopes are especially diverse and including eland, impalas, gazelles oryx, gerenuk, and kudu. Buffalo, wildebeest, plains zebra, rhinos, giraffes, elephants, and warthogs are among other herbivores of the African savanna. Up to sixteen grazing and browsing species may coexist in the same area. They divide the resources spatially and temporally; each having its own food preferences, grazing/browsing height, time of day or year to use a given area, and different dry season refugia.
<p>The species-rich herbivore trophic level supports a diverse set of carnivores, including cats (lions, leopards, cheetahs, servals), dogs (jackals, wild dogs), and hyenas.
<p>Most herbivorous mammals of the open savannas are herd animals, often organized into groups of females and their young with a single dominant male and groups of bachelor males.
<p>In South America a distinct savanna fauna is not well-developed. The capybara, the large semi-aquatic rodent, is associated with the llanos, but is found elsewhere and in other vegetation types as well. Indeed, few if any neotropical mammals are restricted to the savannas. The highest diversity of mammals is found in the dry or seasonal forests. Similarly, most bird species are not restricted to savanna-type habitats.
<p>Termites are especially abundant in the tropical savannas of the world, and their tall termitarias are conspicuous elements of the savanna landscape. These detrivores are important in soil-formation; their termitaria provide shelter for other animals; and they are the beginning of the food chain for anteaters (Neotropical endemics) and aardvarks and pangolins (Ethiopian endemics).

<h3><p>MARINE BIOMES</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/marine.php)
<p><b>OCEANS</b>

<p>The largest of all the ecosystems, oceans are very large bodies of water that dominate the Earth's surface. Like ponds and lakes, the ocean regions are separated into separate zones: intertidal, pelagic, abyssal, and benthic. All four zones have a great diversity of species. Some say that the ocean contains the richest diversity of species even though it contains fewer species than there are on land.
<p>The intertidal zone is where the ocean meets the land - sometimes it is submerged and at other times exposed, as waves and tides come in and out. Because of this, the communities are constantly changing. On rocky coasts, the zone is stratified vertically. Where only the highest tides reach, there are only a few species of algae and mollusks. In those areas usually submerged during high tide, there is a more diverse array of algae and small animals, such as herbivorous snails, crabs, sea stars, and small fishes. At the bottom of the intertidal zone, which is only exposed during the lowest tides, many invertebrates, fishes, and seaweed can be found. The intertidal zone on sandier shores is not as stratified as in the rocky areas. Waves keep mud and sand constantly moving, thus very few algae and plants can establish themselves - the fauna include worms, clams, predatory crustaceans, crabs, and shorebirds.

<p>The pelagic zone includes those waters further from the land, basically the open ocean. The pelagic zone is generally cold though it is hard to give a general temperature range since, just like ponds and lakes; there is thermal stratification with a constant mixing of warm and cold ocean currents. The flora in the pelagic zone includes surface seaweeds. The fauna include many species of fish and some mammals, such as whales and dolphins. Many feed on the abundant plankton.
<p>The benthic zone is the area below the pelagic zone, but does not include the very deepest parts of the ocean (see abyssal zone below). The bottom of the zone consists of sand, slit, and/or dead organisms. Here temperature decreases as depth increases toward the abyssal zone, since light cannot penetrate through the deeper water. Flora are represented primarily by seaweed while the fauna, since it is very nutrient-rich, include all sorts of bacteria, fungi, sponges, sea anemones, worms, sea stars, and fishes.
<p>The deep ocean is the abyssal zone. The water in this region is very cold (around 3° C), highly pressured, high in oxygen content, but low in nutritional content. The abyssal zone supports many species of invertebrates and fishes. Mid-ocean ridges (spreading zones between tectonic plates), often with hydrothermal vents, are found in the abyssal zones along the ocean floors. Chemosynthetic bacteria thrive near these vents because of the large amounts of hydrogen sulfide and other minerals they emit. These bacteria are thus the start of the food web as they are eaten by invertebrates and fishes.

<p><b>COASTAL ECOSYSTEM: -</b> Two types: -

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. <b>CORAL REEFS</b>
<p>Coral reefs are widely distributed in warm shallow waters. They can be found as barriers along continents (e.g., the Great Barrier Reef off Australia), fringing islands, and atolls. Naturally, the dominant organisms in coral reefs are corals. Corals are interesting since they consist of both algae (zooanthellae) and tissues of animal polyp. Since reef waters tend to be nutritionally poor, corals obtain nutrients through the algae via photosynthesis and also by extending tentacles to obtain plankton from the water. Besides corals, the fauna include several species of microorganisms, invertebrates, fishes, sea urchins, octopuses, and sea stars.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <b>ESTUARIES</b>
<p>Estuaries are areas where freshwater streams or rivers merge with the ocean. This mixing of waters with such different salt concentrations creates a very interesting and unique ecosystem. Microflora like algae, and macroflora, such as seaweeds, marsh grasses, and mangrove trees (only in the tropics), can be found here. Estuaries support a diverse fauna, including a variety of worms, oysters, crabs, and waterfowl.
