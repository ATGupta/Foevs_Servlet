<h2 style="text-align: center">GANDHIAN APPROACH</h2>

<p>It is argued that, when seen in light of Gandhi's social philosophy, the concepts of appropriate technology [AT] and basic needs take on new meaning. Gandhi's approach helps to provide greater equinity or "distributive justice" by promoting technology that is appropriate to basic needs (food, health, shelter, education). Gandhi's social philosophy has been neglected by most development specialists except a few (e.g. Chambers, 1983; Charles, 1983). This analysis attempts to draw out some aspects of MK Gandhi's background and thinking about swadesi and swaraj.
<p>Gandhi's ideas, which emerged out of an "Indic" meta-cultural background, are based on the emphasis of equity.

<p><b>Critical appraisal of Gandhian Development Theory: -</b> 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">(i) Gandhi was not an economist in any professional sense. His economic ideas lack systemization and lay scattered here and there in his writings. He attempted no economic analysis and presented no theoretical model.
<br>(ii) In fact, Gandhi has not studied the writings of western economists. He only studied Marx and that, too late in his life during his detention in 1942. Whatever he wrote or said about economists was the natural outburst of his philosophical thought, and was not adopted from any book.
<br>(iii) His thinking on economics does not contain any technical knowledge that has analytical value. He was a practical idealist and was immediately interested in solving the problems in his country.
<br>(iv) The solutions he suggested called for a socioeconomic revolution through means. According to him, to achieve his objective, the country must act according to sarvodaya principles. This is a most unpractical solution. It is a great fantasy to expect that the rich would share their acquisitive [having strong desire] tendencies and would help their poor brethren to ameliorate [to make become better] their poverty.
<br>(v) With the acceptance of sarvodaya principles, the rich are unable free themselves from the lust of profit. And production does not expand due to obsolete methods of production. It leads to perennial [lasting active through a year or more] stagnation [inactivity state].
<br>(vi) Universalizing the idea of non-violence, he hoped, would bring about a change of heart. However, the thought that all countries would follow the path of non-violence is more wishful thinking.
