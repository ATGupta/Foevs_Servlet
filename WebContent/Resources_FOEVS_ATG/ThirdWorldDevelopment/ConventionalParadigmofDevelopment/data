<h2 style="text-align: center">CONVENTIONAL PARADIGM OF DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p><i>[paradigm = a pattern / model]</i>

<p><b>Development</b>: - A specified state of growth or advancement.

<p>The conventional development paradigm assumes that the values, consumption patterns, and dynamics of the western industrial system will be progressively played on a global scale.
<p>We present a global, long range conventional [predictable] development scenario [situation] to the year 2050 and identify environmental pressures and uncertainties. These include the economic and geopolitical consequences of fossil fuel depletion, the environmental and security implications of increased nuclear generation, the threats of social cohesion [to unite] and distributional inequities.
<p>Today's energy patterns and problems emerged from an unprecedented [having no previous example, unparalleled] era of industrialization, cultural transformation, and economic and global change.
<p>The industrial revolution was also an energy revolution. Since the mid-19th century, global energy consumption has increased by a factor of almost 20, while modern fuel forms - fossil fuels, nuclear power, electricity - have largely replaced traditional forms of fuel. There are direct links between energy and many of our most serious environmental problems.

<h3>SOME DRAWBACKS OF DEVELOPMENT</h3> 

<p><b>Stress on resources and market</b>: - 
<p>Development and increased population has resulted in stress on resources. Unemployment and diseases due to air, water, food contamination are examples of the bad consequences of development. Markets are in great pressures. There is a scarcity of many products in many places.

<p><b>Overuse and exploitation of resources</b>: - 
<p>Development also gives us better technology and also needs which result to the exploitation of resources. Sometimes, the enhanced technology also gives rise to exploitation of nature.

<p><b>Diversion of scarce resources into luxury goods</b>: - 
<p>Issues relating to the reconceptualization of peace and the negotiation of social and planetary futures are crucial ones.
<p>The development of the capacity for reflective, imaginative conversation is central to paradigm change.

<p><b>Desperate access to resources</b>: - 
<p>It results to stress on resource, resource pollution, its degradation, loss of biodiversity which a resource supports.

<p><b>Increasing wastes and pollution</b>: - 
<p>Development enhances population and makes it more able to exist. This increasing population generates wastes which
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Is generated from the enhanced technology,
<br>&#8226 Results to pollution and depletes a resource and makes it more unfit for further use.
