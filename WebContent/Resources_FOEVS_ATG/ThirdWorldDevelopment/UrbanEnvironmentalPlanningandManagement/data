<h2 style="text-align: center">URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT</h2>

<p>Urban sustainable development is based on sound urban environmental planning and management. The goal of urban environmental planning and management is to improve and maintain the wellbeing of people as well as improve and maintain the wellbeing of the ecosystem products to achieve the highest possible wellbeing of its people. Thus urban environmental planning is concerned with the whole system, defined as the people within their ecosystem. Humans depend on the ecosystem. They are supported by the ecosystem that surrounds them.

<p><b>Problems of Sanitation: -</b> 
<p>A lack of toilets means that people have no option but to defecate openly, polluting the environment with hazardous, stinking, raw sewage.
<p>Many people resort to using plastic bags that are thrown away. These 'flying toilets' typically end up clogging and polluting drainage channels.
<p>Urban sanitation solutions usually involve communal toilet blocks draining into cesspits or municipal sewers. Users pay a monthly fee or a small charge per use.

<p><b>Sanitation Problems in India: -</b> 
<p>India has a population of almost 1.2 billion people. 55% of this population (nearly 600 million people) has no access to toilets. Most of these numbers are made up by people who live in urban slums and rural areas. A large populace in the rural areas still defecates in the open. Slum dwellers in major metropolitan cities, reside along railway tracks and have no access to toilets or a running supply of water. The main problem in urban areas is poor sewerage systems and highly congested living conditions.

<p><b>Water Management: -</b> 
<p>Water management is the activity of planning, developing, distributing and managing the optimum use of water resources.

<p><b>Urban Water Management in India: -</b> The progress of the urban water supply sector has been somewhat slow in India, in spite of the policy initiatives, because of the improper focus and inadequate reforms in the urban local bodies (ULBs).  Urban water supply is still largely characterized by the public good provided by a local government or aparastatal agency lacking viable mechanisms of financial and economic cost recovery.  The approach to its development is also based on the supply expansion within the means of budgets.  Even large metropolitan cities are yet to undertake basic reforms for improving the efficiency of water service provision and making it financially self sufficient.

<p><b>Transport: -</b> 
<p>Efficient and reliable urban transport systems are crucial for India to sustain a high growth rate and alleviate poverty.  The Urban transport problems in India are growing acute mainly because of rapid motorization.  The major challenge for urban transport agencies in India is how to improve the current urban transport situation, or at least prevent it from deteriorating further.  In order to address these gaps, it is imperative to develop medium term and long term strategies so as to bring in large scale reforms in this sector.  This urban transport sector strategy note, prepared in consultation with the Government of India, is an attempt to provide support to the development of the urban transport agenda in India and to provide lending support in this area.

<p><b>Energy: -</b> 
<p>There is little doubt that Indian cities can do with better energy management. Many real life illustrations have been provided which can be used by individuals, commercial organizations and city administrators to formulate a long-term vision for urban energy management.
<p>To meet energy needs in an economical fashion community based models hold the key by solving integration issues between various technologies for generating useful energy. Awareness programmes are required to reduce leakage of electricity.

<p><b>Air quality: -</b> 
<p>Although much progress has been made on reducing outdoor air pollution in developed countries, many cities in these countries still frequently exhibit levels of pollutants that exceed recommended limits.  All the developed countries have introduced low-sulfur gasoline and have significantly reduced the emission of PM, NO2, and SO2. But situation of developing countries is too bad.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.worstpolluted.org/projects_reports/display/64)

<p><b>Urban Air Quality in India: -</b> 
<p>India being a developing country, the rapid growth in motor vehicle activity in India and rapidly increasing industries contribute to high levels of urban air pollution, which further results to adverse socioeconomic, environmental, health and welfare impacts.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15995891)

<p><b>Housing: -</b> 
<p>According to the Times of India, "a majority of Indians have per capita space equivalent to or less than a 10 feet x 10 feet room for their living, sleeping, cooking, washing and toilet needs." The average is 103 sq. ft. per person in rural areas and 117 sq ft per person in urban areas. 
<p>44 percent of rural households have access to electricity. Although cities have better facilities than villages, except for the major metros no city in India provides full-day water supply.

<p><b>Constraints in tracking environmental problems: -</b> 
<p>A few are as follows: -
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Political uninterest
<br>&#8226 Unawareness among common public
<br>&#8226 Ignorance towards country and environment
<br>&#8226 Illiteracy
<br>&#8226 Increasing population
<br>&#8226 Corruption

<p><b>Incapability of solutions that have worked in first world: -</b>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">(1) Solutions of first world were not logical and technical.
<br>(2) They lacked a scientific approach.
<br>(3) Those solutions gave results very slowly.
<br>(4) They were just theoretical and were based on the personal experiences of the elderlies.

<p><b>Need for indigenous approach to urban environment: -</b> 
<p>There is an urgent need in India for urban development, but in harmony with nature.
<p>This is because: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">1. Urban water, sanitation, transport problems are too major and important for Her (India's) development.
<br>2. Now-a-days, India is undergoing a development which is harmful for nature and environment. Health of public, natural beauty, quality and quantity of natural resources are continuously being degraded.
<br>3. There are plenty of resources in India, but not being used properly. If they are used properly, that is, in harmony with nature, India can achieve a high and short-term development surely in all sectors.

<p><b>A few Solutions - need to adopt and change methods: -</b> 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Rainwater harvesting
<br>&#8226 Garbage segregation
<br>&#8226 Composting
<br>&#8226 Energy from solid and liquid wastes
<br>&#8226 Sewage management {dry toilets, Decentralized Water Management System (DEWATS)}

<p><b>Examples of successful urban planning management of other countries in the third world: -</b> 

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">(1) <u>Cuba (urban agriculture using organic methods)</u>: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Since 1990s, Cuba has developed one of the most successful examples of urban agriculture in the world. Havana, the capital of Cuba, with a population of over two million people, has played a prominent, if not dominant role, in the evolution and revolution of this type of agriculture.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">The entire cultivated area of the Province of the City of Havana belongs to urban agriculture. The serious development of urban agriculture in Cuba began simultaneously with the disappearance of petrochemical inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides, from Cuban markets. Consequently, urban production uses only biological fertilizers and biological and cultural pest control techniques. The limited quantities of petrochemicals available are employed for a few non-urban crops such as sugar, potatoes, and tobacco. In Cuba, the distinction between organic and urban is hardly worth making, as almost all urban agriculture follows organic practices.

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">(2) <u>Cochabamba - (Water management and protests against privatization of water supply)</u>: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">The Cochabamba protests of 2000, also known as the Cochabamba Water War, were a series of protests that took place in Cochabamba, Bolivia's third largest city, between December 1999 and April 2000 in response to the privatization of the city's municipal water supply company Semapa. The new firm, Aguas del Tunari - a joint venture involving Bechtel and Suez Lyonaise - was required to invest in construction of long-envisioned dam (a priority of Mayor Manfred Reyes Villa) - so they dramatically raised water rates. Protests, largely organized through the Coordinadora in Defense of Water and Life, a community coalition, erupted in January, February, and April, culminating in tens of thousands marching downtown and battling police. One civilian, Victor Hugo Daza was killed. On April 10, the national government reached an agreement with the Coordinadora to reverse the privatization. A complaint filed by foreign investors was resolved by agreement in January 2006.
