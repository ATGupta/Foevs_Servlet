<h2 style="text-align: center">INTERNTIONAL LEGAL REGIMES</h2>

<p><b>International trade Regimes: -</b> 
<p>GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade): - GATT was a multilateral agreement regulating international trade. According to its preamble, its purpose was the "substantial reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers and the elimination of preferences, on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis." It was negotiated during the UN Conference on Trade and Employment and was the outcome of the failure of negotiating governments to create the International Trade Organization (ITO). GATT was signed in 1947 and lasted until 1994, when it was replaced by the World Trade Organization in 1995.

<p><b>WTO (World Trade Organization): -</b> 
<p>WTO is an organization that intends to supervise and liberalize international trade. The organization officially commenced on January 1, 1995 under the Marrakech Agreement, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which commenced in 1948. The organization deals with regulation of trade between participating countries; it provides a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements, and a dispute resolution process aimed at enforcing participants' adherence to WTO agreements, which are signed by representatives of member governments and ratified by their parliaments.

<p><u>Functions</u>: - 
<p>The main functions of the WTO can be described in very simple terms. These are:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 To oversee implementing and administering WTO agreements;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 To provide a forum for negotiations; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 To provide a dispute settlement mechanism.
<p>The goals behind these functions are set out in the preamble to the Marrakech Agreement. These include:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Raising standards of living;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Ensuring full employment;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Ensuring large and steadily growing real incomes and demand; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Expanding the production of and trade in goods and services.

<p><u>Disputes Case Study</u>: - 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. <b>Poland - Import Regime for Automobiles</b>
<p>Complaint by India.
<br>This request for consultations, dated 28 September 1995, concerns Poland's preferential treatment of the EC in its tariff scheme on automobiles.
<br>On 16 July 1996, both parties notified a mutually agreed solution to the DSB.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <b>United States - Measures Affecting Imports of Women's and Girls' Wool Coats</b>
<p>Complaint by India.
<br>In a communication dated 14 March 1996, India requested the establishment of a panel, claiming that the transitional safeguard measures on these textile products by the United States were inconsistent with ATC Articles 2, 6 and 8.
<br>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings
<br>A panel was established in the DSB meeting on 17 April 1996.
<br>On 25 April 1996, India requested "termination of further action in pursuance of the decision taken by the DSB on 17 April 1996 to establish a panel" in light of the US removal of the safeguard measures on these products, which came into effect from 24 April 1996.

<p><b>TNCs (Transnational Corporations): -</b> 
<p>A transnational, or multinational, corporation has its headquarters in one country and operates wholly or partially owned subsidiaries in one or more other countries. The subsidiaries report to the central headquarters. The growth in the number and size of transnational corporations since the 1950s has generated controversy because of their economic and political power and the mobility and complexity of their operations.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Transnational+Corporation)

<p><u>Environmental Impacts</u>: -
<p>Often, "shortcuts" are taken by TNCs to maximize profit and production. Environmental laws and regulations are violated, all in the name of economic expansion. As a result of taking all of these shortcuts and violating regulations, environmental catastrophes occur and cost corporations billions of dollars, all of which could be prevented by stepping up on environmental measures and prioritizing the environment. One prime example of such a catastrophe is the BP oil spill, which will later be discussed.
<p>Environmental damages affect everybody, and transnational corporations are not the only ones who suffer the consequences - local communities, wildlife, consumers, and future generations do too. This website will explore the effects of economic expansion by transnational corporations, focusing mainly on Wal-Mart and the BP Oil Spill.

<p><u>IPR (Intellectual Property Rights)</u>: - 
<p>Common types of intellectual property rights include copyright, trademarks, patents, industrial design rights and in some jurisdictions trade secrets.
<p>Although many of the legal principles governing intellectual property rights have evolved over centuries, it was not until the 19th century that the term intellectual property began to be used, and not until the late 20th century that it became commonplace in the majority of the world. The British Statute of Anne 1710 and the Statute of Monopolies 1623 are now seen as the origins of copyright and patent law respectively.
<p>Types: - 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Patents
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Trademark, copyright
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property)

<p><b>Trademark, copyright, geographical indicators and industrial designs: -</b> 
<p>A trademark is a distinctive sign or indicator used by an individual, business organization, or other legal entity to identify for consumers that the products or services on or with which the trademark appears originate from a unique source, designated for a specific market, and to distinguish its products or services from those of other entities.
<p>A trademark may be designated by the following symbols:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 &trade; (the "trademark symbol", which is the letters "TM", for an unregistered trade mark, a mark used to promote or brand goods)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 &#8480 (which is the letters "SM" in superscript, for an unregistered service mark, a mark used to promote or brand services)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 &reg; (the letter "R" surrounded by a circle, for a registered trademark)
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark)

<p><b>Products vs. Processes: -</b> 
<p>A process is the time and effort spent to achieve a product. A product is what we can say, the "fruit" of the process that made it.
<p>In some specialized circles, the product/process distinction is a method used by the WTO to determine whether or not a complaint filed by an importing nation is valid and warrants trade barriers against the exporting nation.

<p><u>Earth Summit</u>: - 
<p>From 3-14 June 1992, Rio de Janeiro hosted the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). The focus of this conference was the state of the global environment and the relationship between economics, science and the environment in a political context. The conference concluded with the Earth Summit, at which leaders of 105 nations gathered to demonstrate their commitment to sustainable development.

<p>Twenty years later, these leaders are meeting again to look at the progress we've made, and the challenges we still face. We've succeeded in solving problems such as the hole in the ozone layer, but a myriad of new problems have come up, and we have reached our full capacity. The Earth Summit 2012 is a chance for nations to commit to real changes and to figure out how they're going to do it.
<p>Earth Summit 2012 has two main themes and three objectives.
<p><b>THEMES</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 A Green Economy in the Context of Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 2. Institutional Framework for Sustainable Development
 
<p><b>OBJECTIVES</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Securing Political Commitment to Sustainable Development
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Current International Agreements
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Addressing New and Emerging Challenges
