<h2 style="text-align: center">TRANS-NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES</h2>
<p><i>[Trans-national = ending beyond boundaries, interests, etc. of single nation; relating to or involving several nations or nationalities]</i>

<p>Off course, all of the environmental issues have become trans-national in today's world.

<p><b>Case Studies: -</b> 

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">1. <u>Amazonia</u>: - [the area surrounding the Amazon river - the amazon rainforest]
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">In fact, the non-profit Rainforest Action Network estimates that more than 20% of the original Amazon Rainforest has gone and that, without stricter environmental laws and sustainable development practices, as much as half of what remains could disappear in a few decades.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Some researchers of Brazil predict more rainforest loss. It has been recently reported in the journal "Nature" that without further projections, more than 770,000, additional square miles of amazon rainforest would be profoundly threatened by the resulting loss in habitat.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">One of the driving forces behind this destruction is the poverty in the region. Looking for ways to make ends meet, poor inhabitants clear tracts of rainforest for its timber value, often with government's permission and then further despoil the clear land through destructive farming and ranching [using farms to raise cattle and sheep] practices.

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">2. <u>Trade in Wildlife</u>: - From small-time poaching and hunting, it has grown into a well-organized, sophisticated network of criminals across the world, who carry out a trade ring worth an estimated 6 to 20 billion dollars worldwide (MoEF, 1994).

<p style="text-align: right">(http://siberiantimes.com/search/?text=illegal%20hunting&tag=1)

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">The United States is the largest consumer of wildlife in the world. India, home to several mega-species such as the tiger, elephant, rhino, snow leopard, and musk deer, which are highly valued in this trade, has consequently become a crucial target for poaching and export of wildlife products.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">In order to deal with this challenge the Government of India passed the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 which prohibits the hunting of all animals. Poaching of tigers is punishable with a maximum of seven years imprisonment and a fine of &#8377; 25,000. India is also a party to the CITES since 1976 and is therefore bound by all its efforts to eliminate international trade in tigers and tiger parts.

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">The global wildlife trade includes primates, ivory from African elephants, orchids, live birds, reptile skins, butterflies, animal furs, and tropical fish. CITES, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora (the Washington Convention) was signed in 1973 providing a mechanism to regulate the trade in wildlife. Under its guidance, governments all over the world have taken steps to prevent this illegal trade and bring it under control.

<p style="margin-left: 150px;">3. <u>Ozone Depletion</u>: - The sun emits UV rays. These are harmful for plants and animal skins. They may even cause skin cancer and cataract.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">The ozone layer protects us from these rays but now-a-days, ozone layer is being depleted due to air pollution. Some of the air pollutant gases react with ozone and form something else. The major gas which harms ozone layer is chlorofluorocarbon (CFC).
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Antarctica is the victim of the ozone layer depletion. There is a large hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica which is as big as 27, 00,000 sq.km., almost the size of United States.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">CFCs are released from refrigerators and air conditioners.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Now-a-days, CFC free refrigerators and ACs are present in market. Scientists are trying to fill the ozone hole by artificially creating ozone.
