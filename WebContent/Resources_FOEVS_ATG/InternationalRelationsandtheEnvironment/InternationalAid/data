<p><b>Need for re-orienting aid: -</b> 
<p>The above discussed advantages and disadvantages imply that there is a need of re-orienting international aid.

<p>Aid vs. Self-reliance: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">a) Aid just makes us dependent, whereas self-reliance makes us able to make out ourselves.
<br>b) Aid is not permanently helpful. On the other hand, self-reliance is a permanent factor.
<br>c) If in case aid supply is stopped, we will starve to death if we are not self-dependent.

<p><b>Tied Aid: -</b> 
<p>Tied aid is foreign aid that must be spent in the country providing the aid (the donor country) or in a group of selected countries. 
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tied_aid)

<p><b>Advantages and disadvantages: -</b> 
<p><u>Advantages</u>:
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">(i) <u>For the Aid-recipient Country</u>:
<p style="margin-left: 200px;">i. The aid-giver is more concerned about promoting the interests of the aided country than its own.
<br>ii. The aid-giver is in a better position than the aided country to take decisions regarding the aided projects and their details.
<br>iii. The volume of aid is adequate, timely, and on an assured long term basis.
<br>iv. Under such conditions, there is also a high probability of aid being on concessional terms.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">(ii) <u>For the Aid-giver</u>:
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">It reduces the risk of default by the aid-recipient, and gives the aid- giver a better control over the design, technology, location, and management, etc., of the aided projects.
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">Tied aid is also expected to generate some extra benefits to the aid-giver country in the form of additional export earnings, secured markets and higher level of domestic employment, and the like.
<p><u>Disadvantages of Tied Aid</u>: -
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">i. It needs no elaboration that for the aid-recipient country, economic cost of the tied aid goes up.
<br>ii. Tied aid restricts the choice of its use by the aid-receiving country.
<br>iii. Aid may be subject to some matching contribution by the aid-receiver. This again leads to a situation where the aid-giver can dictate its own priorities regarding resource allocation by the aid-receiver.

<p><b>Untied Aid: -</b> 
<p>Untied Aid is assistance given to developing countries which can be used to purchase goods and services in virtually all countries. It is contrasted with tied aid which stipulates that goods and services bought with it can only be purchased from the donor country or from a limited selection of countries.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untied_aid)

<p><b>Advantages and Disadvantages of untied aid</b>: - 
<p><u>Advantages</u>: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Advocates of untying aid also stress that it improves the aid's effectiveness.
<br>&#8226 It would facilitate budget support, aiming to dissociate aid from commercial interests in each donor country.
<br>&#8226 It is also widely accepted that untying all aid increases the value of public development aid by providing better cost-effectiveness, thus increasing the total financial resources available for development operations. It is estimated that tying aid increases the cost of many goods and services by between 15 and 30%.
<p><u>Disadvantages</u>: - 
<p>Just one disadvantage, that too, for the aid-giving country, that it will not receive profit from the given aid.
