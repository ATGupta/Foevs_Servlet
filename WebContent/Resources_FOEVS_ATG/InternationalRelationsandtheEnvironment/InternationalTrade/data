<h2 style="text-align: center">INTERNATIONAL TRADE</h2>

<p>International trade is the exchange of goods and services between countries. This type of trade gives rise to a world economy, in which prices, or supply and demand, affect and are affected by global events.

<p><b>Free Trade vs. Protectionism: -</b> 
<p>Free Trade is the trade between nations without protective customs tariffs, whereas, protectionism is the theory or practice of a method of fostering or developing industry through restrictive tariffs on foreign goods and services.
<p>Protectionism is the government practice of restricting imports and exports between one country and another. Tariffs are sometimes placed on imports or exports, raising the price for doing such things. In contrast, free trade removes such restrictions.
<p>The aims of protectionism are to preserve jobs. By increasing the cost of importing, businesses are encouraged to produce products within the country where the products will be sold.
<p>Free trade advocates argue that protectionism leads to higher prices because workers at home are not necessarily willing to work for lower wages.
<p>Free trade allows businesses to trade more frequently, resulting in a greater exchange of goods and services. Businesses also can save money by finding cheaper labor. Free trade often leads to a loss of jobs through outsourcing.
<p>Free Trade is far more preferable than protectionism as protectionism, unlike free trade, increases goods' prices to a high extent.

<p><b>Advantages and disadvantages of free Trade: -</b> 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><u>Advantages of free trade</u>: - 
<p style="margin-left: 200px;">&#8226 Increased production
<br>&#8226 Enhanced production efficiencies
<br>&#8226 Benefits to consumers (Consumers benefit in the domestic economy as they can now obtain a greater variety of goods and services)
<br>&#8226 Foreign exchange gains
<br>&#8226 Employment
<br>&#8226 Economic growth
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><u>Disadvantages of free trade</u>: - 
<p style="margin-left: 200px;">&#8226 With the removal of trade barriers, structural unemployment may occur in the short term.
<br>&#8226 Increased domestic economic instability from international trade cycles, as economies become dependent on global markets.
<br>&#8226 International markets are not a level playing field [as countries with surplus products may dump them on world markets at below cost] 
<br>&#8226 Developing or new industries may find it difficult to become established in a competitive environment.
<br>&#8226 Free trade can lead to pollution and other environmental problems
<br>&#8226 Pressure to increase protection during the GFC [Global Financial Crisis]

<p style="text-align: right">Advantages and Disadvantages of Protectionism: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><u>Strengths of Protectionism</u>: - 
<p style="margin-left: 200px;">&#8226 Protectionism keeps the domestic economy flowing. Since there is a decrease in imports, domestic firms have less competition, and so are able to continue.
<br>&#8226 The domestic economy also strengthens, because the unemployment rate will be minimal. 
<br>&#8226 Protectionism allows the green, fledgling firms to function and develop at a decent rate, because these firms are not pressured by the foreign, more experienced firms. 
<br>&#8226 Protectionism also prevents dumping. This is where foreign, grand economies enter an economy and sell their goods at a price lower than the costs of production. 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><u>Weakness of Protectionism</u>: - 
<p style="margin-left: 200px;">&#8226 Protectionism can cause a retaliation [revenge] reaction from other countries, ruining the relationship of the two nations.
<br>&#8226 Protectionism prevents nations from maximizing their specialization level, using up factors of production moronically inefficiently.

<p><b>Import Barriers: -</b> 
<p>Import Barrier is any regulation or policy that restricts international trade.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.thefreedictionary.com/import+barrier)

<p>The factors which are responsible for restricting international trade and thus act as import barriers: -
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">1. Protecting domestic employment and consumers
<br>2. Tariffs / Taxes
<br>3. Protectionism
<br>4. Infant Industries
<br>5. National Security
<br>6. Retaliation [to return like for like, especially evil for evil] - countries may set tariffs as retaliation techniques.

<p>They all were tariff barriers. Non-tariff barriers are as follows: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">1. Licenses, to a business by a government.
<br>2. Import quotas, restriction imposed on a certain importable good.
<br>3. Voluntary export retains, created by exporting country, rather than importing ones.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/tariff-trade-barrier-basics.asp#axzz25ltnprkM)

<p><b>Domestic industry vs. Free Trade: -</b> 
<p>Domestic Industry is preferred by most of the countries as looked from the point of view of its currency value.
<p>Domestic industry preserves the currency value of a particular country, unlike free trade, and also produces more job opportunity for its citizens. Free trade just flows the national currency of the importing country outside.
<p>Protectionism is done to prevent free trade, to preserve the demands of domestic industry goods, to promote domestic industry and thus to help a country's progress.

<p><b>Trans-national companies: -</b>
<p>Trans-national company is a corporation enterprise that manages production or delivers services in more than 1 country. It can also be referred to as an international corporation or multinational enterprise.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://123writing.com/sample_description.php?sample_id=3)

<p><u>A Historical Perspective: -</u> 
<p>Trans-national companies started with British colonialism only. The British colonialism in India is the best example. In India, the East India Company was a trans-national company. It was established by the British during colonialism in India.
<p>And now, many companies like Reliance, TATA, Maruti are established, receiving a high turnover. They are inspired by the British colonialism.
<p>In many other countries, British colonialism was established and trans-national companies there are inspired by it.

<p><b>Trade between the first and the third world: -</b>

<p>The massive wealth drain from third-world countries to first world elites [a few selected countries - financially powerful] has not prevented the decline of any of developed countries too. Many critics believe that the prosperity of the first world countries is responsible for the poverty of the third world.
<p>Competition is increased so much that the countries apply protectionism and tariffs to the imported goods so that the earned currency can be used in their development.

<p><u>Characteristics</u>: - 
<p>First world trade was simple and prosperous. Goods were too cheap. Even the poorest family was able to afford a healthy living. But the third world countries are mostly developing and underdeveloped. Their response to the foreign goods resulted in the increase in the increasing prices. Most of the people cannot afford such goods.

<p><u>Terms of trade</u>: - 
<p>The terms of trade in the first worlds were acceptable and not very strict. But the third world trade's terms are too strict and a lot of money is wasted in paying taxes only.

<p>India's International Trade: - 
<p><u>Trade in India</u>: -
<p>Trade and commerce have been the backbone of the Indian economy right from ancient times. Textiles and spices were the first products to be exported by India. The Indian trade scenario evolved gradually after the country's independence in 1947. From the 1950s to the late 1980s, the country followed socialist policies, resulting in protectionism and heavy regulations on foreign companies conducting trade with India.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.slideshare.net/shivujagga/international-trade-in-india-ppt)

<p><u>Characteristics</u>: -
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">1. Increase in Indian GNP.
<br>2. Indian trade has fewer shares in world trade.
<br>3. From before independence, composition of Indian export and import has changed a lot.
<br>4. India has only a few ports to handle international trade.
<br>5. Indian foreign trade mainly depends on foreign shipping companies.
<br>6. Most of the Indian trade is carried by sea-ways.
<br>7. Government has set up corporations like State Trading Corporation
<br>8. Minerals and Metal Trading Corporation to run the international trade smoothly.

<p><u>Major Exports and Imports</u>: -
<p>Indian exports comprise mainly of engineering and textile products, precious stones, petroleum products, jewelry, sugar, steel chemicals, zinc and leather products. Most of the exported goods are exempt from export duties.
<p>India's major imports comprise of crude oil machinery, military products, fertilizers, chemicals, gems, antiques and artworks.

<p><u>Foreign Exchange Crisis</u>: - 
<p>The crucial problem is that of foreign exchange shortage. The Second Five Year Plan with its emphasis on the development of industry, mining and transport had a large foreign exchange component. This strain on the balance of payments necessitated the stiffening of import policy at a later stage. India was also at that time negotiating with the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) in respect of loans to cover the foreign exchange needs of several of its development projects. India was also exploring possibilities of deferred payments in respect of imports of capital goods from various countries.
<p>In 1980s, there had been some degree of relaxation in foreign exchange control regime. However, there were huge macroeconomic imbalances. The fiscal deficit of the central government averaged around 4-5 per cent of GDP by the end of 1970s and it rose to around 8.5 per cent of GDP in 1985-86.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://isidev.nic.in/pdf/ICSSR_TPB.pdf)

<p><u>The export imperative and its impact on environment</u>: - 
<br><i>[imperative = having power to control]</i>

<p>Indian exports continue to show robust growth, an unprecedented 32.40% for April-June 06, on a provisional basis. Even if we compare with last year's (2005's) actual figures, it shows a healthy 17% growth, year-over-year, which is highly impressive.
<p>Adverse impacts on environment are just due to accidents, oil spills, accidental fires. India exports crude oil in large quantities whose depletion is another environmental problem in the present world.
<p style="text-align: right">(http://www.financialexpress.com/news/the-export-imperative/171466/1)

<p><b>The case study of Aquaculture in India: -</b> 
<p>India is making rapid strides with its Blue revolution and today, ranks third in the world in aquaculture. Prawns and shrimps rank as the highest foreign exchange earner among our marine product exports, with farmed shrimps accounting for close to half of the total shrimp exports in volumes and fetching over 70 per cent in value.
<p>India is a major supplier of shrimp to Japan, Europe, USA. European Union and US FDA play an essential role in enhancing business prospects for export of Indian aquaculture products.

<p><b>Diversion of scarce source from production subsistence needs to commercial products: -</b> 
<p>Subsistence production of commercial goods with respect to international trade means that production of goods in a particular country so that it can be self-sufficient and does not depend on any other country.
<p>It is to prevent the scarcity of goods. It also helps in protection of currency value, job opportunities, national value in international trade.
<p>So diversion of scarce resource from production of subsistence needs to commercial products is needed in developing and underdeveloped country.

<p><b>Toxic Waste Trade: -</b> 
<p>Hundreds of cases were documented where developed countries have traded or transferred toxic waste problems to developing countries. In 1990, 400 million metric tons of hazardous waste was generated world-wide. As disposal facilities for hazardous waste become scarcer and more costly in industrialized countries, lesser developed countries are being increasingly targeted as dumping grounds.
<p><u>Extent and Impact</u>: - 
<p>This type of trade is immoral and environmentally destructive to the receiving countries and their people. It also prevents developed countries from investing in real solutions to pollution, and developing future markets in more appropriate technologies or products.
<p>Toxic wastes often contain carcinogens, and exposure to these by some route, such as leakage or evaporation from the storage, causes cancer to appear at increased frequency in exposed individuals.
<p>It also results to bioaccumulation of mercury which is caused by the waste in water and it reaches animal and human diets through fishes.

<p><b>Globalization: -</b> 
<p>Globalization is the process of increasing the connectivity and interdependence of the world's markets. It is the integration of economic, political, and cultural systems across the globe. It is the integration among the people, companies and governments of different nations, a process driven by international trade and investment and aided by information technology.

<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><b>Advantages and Disadvantages: -</b> 

<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><u>Good sides</u>: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Globalization lets countries do what they can do best. If, for example, we buy cheap steel from another country we don't have to make our own steel. We can focus on computers or other things.
<br>&#8226 Globalization gives us a larger market. We can sell more goods and make more money. We can create more jobs.
<br>&#8226 Consumers also profit from globalization. Products become cheaper and we can get new goods more quickly.

<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><u>Bad sides</u>: - 
<p style="margin-left: 150px;">&#8226 Globalization causes unemployment in industrialized countries because firms move their factories to places where they can get cheaper workers.
<br>&#8226 Globalization may lead to more environmental problems. A company may want to build factories in other countries because environmental laws are not as strict as they are at home. Poor countries in the Third World may have to cut down more trees so that they can sell wood to richer countries.
<br>&#8226 Globalization can lead to financial problems. In the 1970s and 1980s countries like Mexico, Thailand, Indonesia or Brazil got a lot of money from investors who hoped they could build up new businesses there. These new companies didn't work, so they had to close down and investors pulled out their money.
<br>&#8226 Some of the poorest countries in the world, especially in Africa, may get even poorer. Their population is not as educated as in developed countries and they don't have the new technology that we do.
<br>&#8226 Human, animal and plant diseases can spread more quickly through globalization.
