<h2 style="text-align: center">SOCIAL ORGANIZATION</h2>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>All the sorts of people have some social organizations of their own kind. We will discuss the social organizations of the people who live their life by the 4 main modes of existence discussed, namely, hunting and gathering, pastoral, agricultural and industrial.

<h3><p>Hunters and Gatherers </h3>
<p>Hunter-gatherers typically live in bands with no central leader. Instead of a ruler, leadership is in the form of respected individuals who can persuade the group to do things, but who have no real power. Because everyone has a relatively equal share of the available resources, hunter-gatherers are egalitarian.
<p>The basic unit in the societies of both hunter-gatherers and small scale food producers is the household, which is a small group of people related by kinship who live in the same structure and are dependent on one another for food and economic resources. 
<p>Hunter-gatherers have lower population densities because they usually do not store food, so they must rely on what the land provides. They move around much more than food producers and need to be able to do so easily.

<h3><p>Pastoralists</h3> 
<p>Nomadic pastoralists have a global food-producing strategy depending on the management of herd animals for meat, skin, wool, milk, blood, manure, and transport. Nomadic pastoralism is practiced in different climates and environments with daily movement and seasonal migration. Pastoralists are among the most flexible populations. Pastoralist societies have had field armed men protect their livestock and their people and then to return into a disorganized pattern of foraging. The products of the herd animals are the most important resources, although the use of other resources, including domesticated and wild plants, hunted animals, and goods accessible in a market economy are not excluded. The boundaries between states impact the viability of subsistence and trade relations with cultivators.
<p>All pastoralist strategies typify effective adaptation to the environment. 
<p>Pastoralists are constantly moving, which puts them at odds with sedentary people of towns and cities. The resulting conflicts could result in all-out war for disputed lands. These disputes are recorded in ancient times in the Middle East.

<h3><p>Agriculturalists</h3>
<p>When men first came about, they were hunters-gathers. However, with the beginning of agriculture in 8000 B.C., men no longer hunted for food but instead, grew their own crops of wheat rice, millet and barley. In civilizations which developed along rivers, like Egypt, China, India and Mesopotamia, people grew crops along the river banks where the soil is very fertile, and made used of the water from the rivers to irrigate the land especially during the dry seasons, so as to ensure that the crops received enough water for healthy growth.
<p>The development of agriculture served to be a breakthrough for men, as it made life much simpler. It also meant that there was more food for more people, as it was possible to grow many different types of crops on a single piece of land. It also resulted in the development of settlements and ultimately the building of cities. In addition, it ensured that there was a food supply that the people could depend on. More food available meant that more people could be fed, which led to increasing populations. With more people in the society, there were more people available for more kinds of work and thus resulted in the development of more sophisticated social systems.
