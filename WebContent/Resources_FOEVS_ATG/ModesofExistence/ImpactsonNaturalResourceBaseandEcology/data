<h2 style="text-align: center">IMPACTS ON NATURAL RESOURCE BASE AND ECOLOGY</h2>

<p>All the modes of existence for humans have various good or bad impacts on the environment. We'll discuss those impacts in this chapter.

<h3><p>Impacts of hunting: -</h3>
<p><b>Population Control</b>
<p>Many states that allow hunting of specific animals, such as deer, turkeys and ducks, place restrictions on hunters. Specific seasons are set aside for hunting each species. Depending on the animal, some states also place restrictions on which sex and how many animals a hunter can kill. All of these restrictions help keep populations from dropping too low. However, if hunting was not allowed at all, some animals could become too numerous and create overpopulation issues.
<p><b>Environmental Balance</b>
<p>Because hunters are only allowed to pursue specific species, some environmentalists argue that hunting creates an imbalance in the natural elements of the environment. For instance, if an animal that is typically a predator is hunted to lower numbers, their prey will increase in number. Nature has a delicate balance and hunting can have an impact on that natural balance. Opponents to hunting claim that animals have their own ways of population control and humans are not needed to aid that process. 
<p><b>Extinction</b>
<p>In some cases, hunting has been the cause of extinction of about 23 percent of animal extinctions according to the University of Michigan. Whales and some African animals have become endangered due to hunting issues. Even with hunting restrictions in place, poaching, which is illegal hunting, is still an issue. In less populated areas, it can be difficult to catch and punish those who are over hunting a particular species.
<p><b>Environmental Contribution</b>
<p>Hunters may take animals out of the environment, which could have a negative impact on the environment. However, they also often contribute to the environment in a positive manner. The fees collected by the Department of Natural Resources for hunting licenses, park permits and other fees are used to improve the environment. Some hunters also contribute on their own to environmental organizations that conserve and preserve wildlife and natural areas. Hunters generally have respect for the environment and nature and make an effort to give back, even as they take away.

<h3><p>Impacts of pastoral: -</h3> 
<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Overgrazing causes soil infertility. Too many animals eat in a small piece of land and plants are uprooted out.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 This loss of plants from soil also causes soil erosion, because there is no plant left so that its root can hold the soil.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 It ensures security of various animal species who are globally on a verge of extinction.

<h3><p>Impacts of agriculture: -</h3> 
<p><b>Eutrophication</b>
<p>Eutrophication is defined as an increase in the rate of supply of organic matter in an ecosystem.
<p>The process by which a body of water acquires a high concentration of nutrients, especially phosphates and nitrates. Main source of these chemicals are the chemicals used by farmers used in their farms. These typically promote excessive growth of algae. As the algae die and decompose, high levels of organic matter and the decomposing organisms deplete the water of available oxygen, causing the death of other organisms, such as fish. Eutrophication is a natural, slow-aging process for a water body, but human activity greatly speeds up the process.
<p><b>Climate change</b>
<p>Climate change and agriculture are interrelated processes, both of which take place on a global scale. Global warming is projected to have significant impacts on conditions affecting agriculture, including temperature, precipitation and glacial run-off. These conditions determine the carrying capacity of the biosphere to produce enough food for the human population and domesticated animals. Rising carbon dioxide levels would also have effects, both detrimental and beneficial, on crop yields. The overall effect of climate change on agriculture will depend on the balance of these effects.
<p><b>Loss of forest cover</b> 
<p>One of the causes of deforestation is to clear land for pasture or crops. According to British environmentalist Norman Myers, 5% of deforestation is due to cattle ranching, 19% due to over-heavy logging, 22% due to the growing sector of palm oil plantations, and 54% due to slash-and-burn farming. 
<p><b>Genetic engineering</b>
<p>Genetic engineering has caused controversies.
<br>Seed contamination is problematic.
<p><b>Impacts of irrigation: -</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Depletion of underground aquifers through overdrafting.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Underirrigation leads to increased soil salinity with consequent build-up of toxic salts on soil surface in areas with high evaporation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Overirrigation because of poor distribution uniformity or management wastes water, chemicals, and may lead to water pollution.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Irrigation with saline or high-sodium water may damage soil structure owing to the formation of alkaline soil.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Runoff causing surface water and groundwater-aquifer hydrologic cycle water pollution.
<p><b>Pollutants which originate from agriculture: -</b> 
<p>A wide range of agricultural chemicals are used and some become pollutants through use, misuse, or ignorance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Pesticide drift. Pesticide drift includes the following three environmental impacts: -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9675 soil contamination
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9675 groundwater and water pollution
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9675 air pollution spray drift
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Pesticides, especially those based on organochloride
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Pesticide residue in foods
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Pesticide toxicity to bees
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9675 List of crop plants pollinated by bees
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9675 Pollination management
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Bioremediation
<p><b>Soil degradation</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 soil contamination
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 erosion
<p><b>Waste generation by agriculture: -</b>
<p>Plasticulture, the use of plastic materials in agriculture, raises problems around how to carry out the recycling of agricultural plastics.

<h3><p>Industrial impact on environment: -</h3> 
<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Pollution of oil into marine environments, though largely caused by urban runoff, is also the result of untreated waste from industries and discharged into surrounding rivers.   
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 A couple of sources of pollution are acid rain and the direct emission of chemical and other industrial waste.   Acid rain is the result of increased release of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Generally, microorganisms are most affected by the acidity change, affecting additional species higher on the food chain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Mining is another source of pollution. It makes the land barren. No further plant growth can take place.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Air pollution is caused by the gases such as N2O, NOx, SO2, CO. it also results to global warming.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226 Oil spills cut off oxygen supply inside waterbodies. Marine animals die in large quantities.
