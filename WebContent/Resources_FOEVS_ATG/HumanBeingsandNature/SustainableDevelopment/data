<h2 style="text-align: center">SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</h2>

<p>Sustainable development is the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Such a development can take place only when we take care that the natural environment around us.
<p>All definitions of sustainable development require that we see the world as a system - a system that connects space; and a system that connects time.
<p>When we think of the world as a system over space, we grow to understand that air pollution from North America affects air quality in Asia, and that pesticides sprayed in Argentina could harm fish stocks off the coast of Australia.
<p>And when we think of the world as a system over time, we start to realize that the decisions our grandparents made about how to farm the land continue to affect agricultural practice today; and the economic policies we endorse today will have an impact on urban poverty when our children are adults.
<p>The first use of the term sustainable was by Club of Rome in March 1972.

<p><b>Major Achievements of India in Sustainable Development: -</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. India's sustained efforts towards reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) will ensure that the country's per capita emission of GHG will continue to be low until 2030-31, and it is estimated that the per capita emission in 2031 will be lower than per capita global emission of GHG in 2005, according to a new study. Even in 2031, India's per capita GHG emissions would stay under four tonnes of CO2, which is lower than the global per capita emission of 4.22 tonnes of CO2 in 2005.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The contribution of renewable energy to the power business in India has now reached 70 per cent, compared to 10 per cent in 2000.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. As per IGBC, about 2-3 per cent of all construction in India is green, as good as (in) the US. In the next two or three years, we want to bring it up to 10 per cent, which will put us on top.
