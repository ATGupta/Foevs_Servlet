<p><b>Feminism in India: -</b>
<p>Feminists in India have struggled to seek
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Gender equality
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Right to work at equal wages
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Right to equal access to health and education
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Equal political rights
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Inheritance laws
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Abolition of Sati, widow immolation
<p>The history of feminism in India can be divided into 3 phases: -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. When European colonists began to seek out for sati.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. When M.K. Gandhi incorporated women's movements to Quit India Movement and independent women's organizations began to emerge.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. At post-Independence which has focused on fair treatment of women in the work force and right to political party.

<p>Despite of progress made by Indian Feminists, women living in present India are facing many issues of discrimination. In past two decades, there has also emerged a disturbing trend of sex selective abortion (female foeticide) and female infanticide.
