<h2 style="text-align: center">MORDERN SCHOOLS OF ECOLOGICAL THOUGHT</h2>

<p>People are continuously exploiting nature and its resources for their own selfish profit. So, there is a need of creating awareness in them and give them knowledge of the alternatives.
<p>Considering this fact, government and various NGOs have established some schools. The main aim of such schools is to create awareness of forthcoming danger regarding environment and to train the people so that they get the knowledge of alternatives of the nature harming materials and methods of using those alternatives. Such schools are called Schools of Ecological Thought.
<p>Generally the nature friendly alternatives of polluting agents are extracted from old traditional methods. But now, these schools are using modern technology along with them. This enhances the efficiency of those alternatives. Therefore, these schools are called Modern Schools of Ecological Thought.
<p>For example, people use biological cow dung in their fields as manure, some use industrially prepared fertilizers and manure. But now, biogas has been evolved. Actually it is a quite old technique. It gives us a combustible gas which can be used in cooking which gives about 5 times more energy than dry dung cakes. And the manure we get at the bottom is 40% more fertile than the cow dung used directly. Therefore, it gives an alternative of using LPG cylinders at kitchens also.
