<p>Green Politics in India: -</b> 
<p>It's a Crowd of political ideologies out in India. But there is one missing piece—it's the 'greens'. The reason for the absence is simple. India has never had political space for pure-play environmental parties.
<p>The famed Chipko movement of 1974, wherein villagers from present-day Uttarakhand hugged trees to prevent them from being cut, was both a livelihood and a conservation issue. That's unlike in rich Europe, where environment is an agenda in itself. Not surprisingly, the greens have managed to get respectable political space in Europe.
<p>Though needed, an effective 'green party' might not come into being immediately in India.
