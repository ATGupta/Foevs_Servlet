<h2 style="text-align: center">SOCIAL ECOLOGY</h2>

<p><b>Social ecology</b> is a philosophy founded by radical Green author and activist Murray Bookchin in 1960s. Social ecology advocates a reconstructive and transformative outlook on social and environmental issues. It suggests that the roots of current ecological and social problems can be drawn to hierarchical [interconnected, interacting and multiplicative] modes of social organization.
<p>Social ecology's 'social' component comes from its position that nearly all of the world's ecological problems stem from social problems; with these social problems in turn arising from structures and relationships of dominating hierarchy.

<p><b>Marxist Environmentalism: -</b> 
<p>Marxism is an economic and sociopolitical worldview and method of socioeconomic inquiry countered upon a materialistic interpretation of history and an analysis - critique of the development of capitalism. It was pioneered by two German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engles. It is an ideology.

<p>In the time period in which Karl Marx wrote, the environment was far less of an issue, and Marx's work was not highly concerned with the environment or environmental problems.  Despite this, there are some important contributions to the theory of the environment made by Marxism.
<p>The environment was primarily seen by Marx as a medium for human labor.  He felt that nature was to be used by humans for their production purposes.  Though humanity was a part of nature, nature's destiny was to be shaped by human labor.
<p>In the long run, history would witness the humanization of nature and the naturalization of humanity.  The ultimate stage of Communism, from the environmental point of view, would mean that nature had been humanized to the greatest possible extent.
<p>Through science and technology, Marx thought humanity would progress to develop greater control over nature.  In doing so, people would free themselves from dependency on the environment, mastering it instead of being enslaved by it.
<p>This is Marxist Environmentalism.

<p><b>Barry Commoner: -</b> 
<p>Commoner was born in 1917.  He attended Harvard University and received a doctorate in biology in 1941.  In his work as a biologist, Commoner has focused especially on ozone layer depletion. 
<p>In the 1950s, Commoner began to push for atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, thereby bringing himself into public prominence.  In the 1960s, he became involved in other environmental issues; these included pollution and energy sources.  He gave speeches and wrote numerous books: Science and Survival (1967), The Closing Circle (1971), Energy and Human Welfare (1975), The Poverty of Power (1976), The Politics of Energy (1979), and Making Peace with the Planet (1990).

<p>Commoner's solutions for many problems are considered radical. Commoner believed that industrial methods, especially those involving fossil fuels, are causing environmental pollution.  He is a strong advocate of renewable energy sources, specifically solar energy, which would decentralize electric utilities and use sunlight as an alternative power source for most energy consumers.
<p>Commoner died in 2012.

<p><b>Social Ecology: -</b>
<p>It includes 4 laws as formulated by physicist and ecologist, Barry Commoner, commonly known as <b>The Four Laws of Ecology</b>. They correlate socialism and ecology -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. <b>Everything is connected to everything else</b> - humans and other species are connected / dependent on a number of other species.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <b>Everything must go somewhere</b> - no matter what you do, and no matter what you use, it has to go somewhere. For example, when you burn wood, it doesn't disappear, it turns into smoke which rises into the air, and ash, which falls back down to the earth
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. <b>Nature knows best</b> - Nature is the best - the mother of all the creatures. Nature is the only perfect. No one can master Her, She is the master of all. If anybody goes beyond the rules of Nature or tries to master Her, he has to pay for it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. <b>There is no such thing as a free lunch</b> - Everything you do, must have a reason behind it. For example, a class pizza party. In order to win the party, you have to fill out a survey, and submit it back to your teacher. This law basically means you have to do something in order to get something in return.
