<h2 style="text-align: center">STEWADSHIP OF LAND</h2>

<p>"Steward" means a person or a body who is responsible to manage a natural resource. "Stewardship" is an ethic that embodies responsible planning and management of resource(s).
<br>Therefore "Stewardship of land" means planning and management of land resources.
<p>Now-a-days, we are dumping nuclear and other non-biodegradable wastes on / in land. We cut the trees for agricultural and building purposes. A huge area of land becomes infertile after mining.
<p>All these activities degrade land. This results into soil erosion, land infertility and poisoning of land. So we must manage and protect land resources.
<p>In this context, Wendell Berry proved to be a volunteer. He wrote books and essays on land management and stewardship.

<p>The Native Americans, original caretakers of this land, understood stewardship and the unequivocal responsibility that people have to maintain balance with the environment. One can only imagine their utter shock when the early Europeans arrived and brought with them (besides disease) the notion of greed. Rather than taking only what was required for sustenance and wasting nothing, these newcomers had little respect for the land or the animals which inhabited it. Four centuries following the arrival of Europeans to this continent, Wendell Berry has not only recognized the consequences of such an evil, selfish attitude toward nature, he dedicated his life to raise awareness of our less-than-desirable state while actively pursuing change. 

<p><i>"WE ARE DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY - I mean our country itself, our land. This is a terrible thing to know, but it is not a reason for despair unless we decide to continue the destruction. If we decide to continue the destruction, that will not be because we have no other choice. This destruction is not necessary. It is not inevitable, except that by our submissiveness we make it so." </i>

<p><b>Methods of Land Stewardship: -</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Contour / Terrace farming
<br>[Terrace farming is a type of farming that was developed first by the Inca people. This method of farming uses "steps", called andenes, that are built into the side of a mountain or hill. On each anden, various crops are planted, and when it rains, instead of washing away all of the nutrients in the soil, the nutrients are carried down to the next level. Additionally, these "steps" prevent a free flowing avalanche of water that would take plants with it and destroy the all of the crops on the hillside. This system also allowed them to build channels, which carried water to each andenes.]

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Basin listing 
<br>[Basin Listing is a way of working land by constructing small dams at intervals across furrows to form basins for collecting rainwater, slowing runoff and erosion.]
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Water harvesting
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Scientific Slope Management
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Afforestation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Replacement of chemical fertilizers by natural manure
